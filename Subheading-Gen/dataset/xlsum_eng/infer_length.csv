uk-37239256,Thousands of children reported over indecent images,"More than 2,000 children were reported to police in three years over indecent images, the NSPCC says.","The children's charity submitted a Freedom of Information request spanning 2013-15 to police across the UK. This showed 2,031 under-18s were reported for crimes linked to the possession, distribution, or production of indecent images of children. NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said children had to be educated about staying safe both offline and online. The law states that making or sharing indecent photographs of anyone aged under the age of 18 could be classed as an offence - but there have been calls for recording rules to be adapted so children are not routinely criminalised. The NSPCC sent the 45 police forces across the UK an FOI in May, and found the total offences of this nature recorded, regardless of age, were 4,530 in 2013, 6,303 in 2014, and 10,818 in 2015. Not all police forces provided age breakdowns, but for those which did, there were 11,697 investigations where the age of the defendant was recorded and 2,031 were under the age of 18.

science-environment-40889934,Climate change has shifted the timing of European floods,"Climate change has had a significant impact on the timing of river floods across Europe over the past 50 years, according to a new study.","By Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent In some regions, such as southern England, floods are now occurring 15 days earlier than they did half a century ago. But the changes aren't uniform, with rivers around the North Sea seeing floods delayed by around eight days. The study has been published in the journal Science. Floods caused by rivers impact more people than any other natural hazard, and the estimated global damages run to over a $100bn a year. Researchers have long predicted that a warming world would have direct impacts on these events but until now the evidence has been hard to establish. Floods are affected by many different factors in addition to rainfall, such as the amount of moisture already in the soil and other questions such as changes in land-use that can speed up water run-off from hillsides. This new study looks at this issue in some depth, by creating a Europe-wide database of observations from 4,262 hydrometric stations in 38 countries, dating back to 1960. The analysis finds a clear but complex impact of climate change on river flooding. The most consistent changes are in north-eastern Europe around Scandinavia where earlier snow melt due to warmer temperatures is leading to earlier spring floods. Around 50% of monitoring stations are seeing floods eight days earlier than they did 50 years ago. The biggest changes are seen along the western edge of Europe, from Portugal up to Southern England. Half the stations recorded floods at least 15 days earlier than previously. A quarter of the stations saw flooding more than 36 days earlier than in 1960. In these regions, the issue isn't snow melt - it's more about saturated soils. Maximum rainfall tends to occur in the autumn and gets stored in the soils. Heavier and earlier rain means that the groundwater reaches capacity earlier. ""It's the interplay between extreme rainfall and the abundance of rainfall,"" lead author Prof Günter Blöschl, from the Technical University of Vienna, told BBC News. ""In southern England, it has been raining more, longer and more intensely than in the past. This has created a rising groundwater table and higher soil moisture than usual and combined with intense rainfall this produces earlier river floods."" However, around the North Sea, in the Netherlands, Denmark and Scotland, the trend is towards later floods. The scientists believe this is due to changes in the North At"

Five of the six were bailed in April, but could not leave India. The charity hopes all six men will be reunited with their families soon. The Mission's director of justice and public affairs, Ken Peters, said: ""Following the judgement, we hope that the crew will be reunited with their families in the next week to 10 days, and we will continue to provide any support or advice necessary.""

education-42707654,Is social mobility really about school cash?,"If you took a list of the top 20 places in England where schools have the most funding, 18 of them would be in London.","Sean CoughlanEducation correspondent And if you took another list, of the top 20 places with the highest level of social mobility, 17 of them would also be in London. Is that a coincidence? Head teachers in the Worth Less? campaign over school funding shortages say that if the government is serious about promoting social mobility in education, then it needs to look at how low funding seems to mirror low mobility. West Somerset has the lowest place on the government's social mobility index - and is also one of the lowest-funded areas. The Worth Less? campaign, which has brought together about 5,000 schools over the issue of fair funding, has produced an analysis showing that a secondary school in West Somerset would receive £2m less per year than a similar sized school in Westminster. Westminster, in the top 10 for funding, is rated as giving its disadvantaged young people the highest chance of social mobility in the country. And a key aspect of the success of London's schools has been that poorer youngsters, such as those eligible for free school meals, do much better in the capital than elsewhere. Funding gaps Of course, there are many other crosswinds in such a complex topic. Schools in London get more funding because they have bigger challenges - extra costs because of their location and extra demands, such as high levels of deprivation and many pupils speaking English as a second language. It has often been claimed that London has its own demographic microclimate, with many migrant families arriving with high ambitions for their children. But head teachers argue that there's no escaping the overlap between social mobility and financial support. None of the lowest-funded 20 authorities makes it into the top 50 for social mobility. And the top 10s for funding and social mobility are shuffling very similar packs. Top 10 for funding Top 10 for social mobility Jules White, a head teacher from West Sussex who has co-ordinated the Worth Less? school funding campaign, is calling for a much closer look at what the variation in funding really means for those outside the capital. The funding gap between West Somerset and Westminster, for an individual school, is the equivalent of dozens of extra teaching staff, afte"

The Northampton-born player, 29, had suffered chest pains in the past three years, Bolton Coroner's Court heard. In a narrative verdict, assistant deputy coroner Peter Watson said Mr Butcher died from natural causes due to a naturally occurring heart condition. ""All deaths are tragic but especially in cases with someone so young and on the face of things he was a very fit and healthy young man, it is so sad that on the balance of probabilities he died from this cardiac condition,"" Mr Watson said.

business-36311126,UK inflation rate falls on cheaper air fares,"The UK's inflation rate fell in April for the first time since September, largely because of cheaper air fares after the Easter holidays.","The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index, fell to 0.3%. The ONS said the main causes were falls in the prices of air fares, vehicles, clothing and social housing rents. The Bank of England said last week that it expected inflation to increase in the second half of the year. By far the largest downward effect in April came from air transport, with prices falling by 14.2%, compared with a rise of 4.5% between the same two months last year. This was influenced by the timing of the Easter holidays in March. Fare prices increased dramatically between February and March this year and then fell sharply in April. The price of clothing and footwear also fell as retailers dropped prices to try to revive sales hit by last month's cold weather. An alternative inflation measure, the Retail Prices Index, which is still used to index some rents and pensions, also fell from an annual rate of 1.6% in March to 1.3% in April. Meanwhile core inflation, which strips out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, fell to 1.2%, compared with economists' expectations for 1.4%.

business-26891682,Why bamboo is booming again in Taiwan,"Bamboo is ubiquitous in Chinese culture. Sturdy and tenacious, it symbolises virtue.","By Cindy SuiBBC, Taipei In fact, the plant has had a profound impact on the daily life, culture and spirituality of the Chinese. In the past, a wide variety of products were made from bamboo - from roof tiles and rafts, to shoes, furniture and agricultural tools. But despite the close relationship between Chinese-speaking societies and the natural material, Taiwan's bamboo industry has suffered a decline in recent decades. It nearly collapsed because of people's preference for more modern-looking products, or just cheaper plastic goods - and the impact of less expensive bamboo imports from China and South East Asia. Nowhere was this more apparent than in central Taiwan's Zhushan or ""Bamboo Mountain"" town. Hundreds of families used to make bamboo products there in the centre of the country's bamboo industry. Now there are only about 50. It's a trend reflected in other parts of Taiwan - only about 240 bamboo-products businesses remain on the island. ""In the past, every part of Taiwan had people working in this industry, but over the years, bamboo has been replaced by plastic or steel to make all sorts of products, such as clothes hanging poles, baby cribs, and furniture,"" says Yang Chun-hsien, director of the Forestry Bureau's reforestation and production division. However, an earthquake and strong resolve on the part of the government and industry to continue using bamboo have led to a revival and transformation in its use. In recent years, bamboo has been used to make items never before associated with the plant - from shampoo and insect repellent, to socks, gloves, and even roasted peanuts. This reinvention of how bamboo is used has made it possible for the small family businesses which make up the industry to stay alive and to start reversing the decades of decline. Health benefits? At the height of bamboo production in Taiwan in the 1970s, more than 13 million stalks were harvested each year, and sales of the stalks alone - not including the finished products - amounted to $3.5m (£2.1m) per annum. But in the past decade, the annual harvest amounted to only about 1.67 million stalks with sales adding up to just $456,000 - a little over 10% of the peak level. Production and sales, however, have been steadily climbing in recent years. Following a devastating earthquake on 21 September 1999 centred in Nantou county, where Zhushan lies, the central government decided to help the local economy by commissioning the country's non-profit Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) to find new ways to help the bamboo industry grow. ITRI developed a method to carbonise bamboo stalks to produce high quality bamboo charcoal, which has a multitude of different uses. Naturally insulating, the charcoal can be turned into fibres and woven into fabric to make hats, scarves, gloves, socks and pants. Also said to be health giving, it is increasingly added to bodycare products, such as skin creams. Meanwhile, in industry it is used to purify water and air. Yet its most unusual application has to be in the production of bamboo charcoal-coated peanuts - which look exactly as they sound - peanuts covered "

President Trump had urged protesters to march on the Capitol after making false claims of electoral fraud. Ms Patel said the president's words had fuelled the violence and he ""didn't do anything to de-escalate that"". Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the ""disgraceful scenes"" and called for a ""peaceful and orderly transfer of power"". Mr Trump has since said there will be an ""orderly transition"" to Democrat Joe Biden, whose November election victory has now been certified by US lawmakers. But he added that he continued to ""totally disagree"" with the outcome of the vote, repeating his unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud. 'Awful beyond words' Hundreds of the president's supporters stormed the Capitol - where lawmakers were meeting to confirm Mr Biden's election victory - and staged an occupation of the building in Washington DC. Both chambers of Congress were forced into recess, as protesters clashed with police and tear gas was released. Ms Patel told BBC Breakfast the scenes were ""awful beyond words"". The home secretary said: ""His comments directly led to the violence, and so far he has failed to condemn that violence and that is completely wrong."" She added: ""He basically has made a number of comments yesterday that helped to fuel that violence and he didn't actually do anything to de-escalate that whatsoever... what we've seen is completely unacceptable."" The home secretary added that America ""needs to move on"" and have the transition of power from Mr Trump to Mr Biden. A woman died after being shot by police, and three others died as a result of ""medical emergencies"", local police said.

He has been strongly criticised by some Tories - one minister said it marked a ""disgusting moment"" in politics. And Home Secretary Sajid Javid called for ""measured language"" to be used. Writing in the same paper, the current Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called for people to rally behind Mrs May, backing her to hold the line ""in the face of intense pressure"". The UK is leaving the EU on 29 March 2019, and the government's plan - agreed at Chequers in July - has sparked criticism from Brexiteer Tories as well as the EU. In his article, Mr Johnson accused the EU of ""bullying"" the UK - but questioned why the response had been ""so utterly feeble"". He said that rather than getting a ""generous free trade deal"", Britain is saying, ""yes sir, no sir, three bags full sir"", to Brussels. ""At every stage of the talks so far, Brussels gets what Brussels wants,"" wrote Mr Johnson. ""It is a humiliation. We look like a seven-stone weakling being comically bent out of shape by a 500lb gorilla."" He said the reason for the UK's response was the ""insanity of the so-called backstop"" - the commitment by the UK and the EU to come up with a solution to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. However, his call to scrap the proposed backstop has been heavily criticised by Sinn Féin and the SDLP. Sinn Fein said Mr Johnson's comments were ""foolish and dangerous"", while the SDLP said he had ""absolutely no regard for people on this island"". The BBC's political correspondent Alex Forsyth said the ""scathing remarks"" by Mr Johnson showed his ""willingness to challenge the prime minister remains undimmed"" after recent revelations about his private life. It is Mr Johnson's second attack on the prime minister's Brexit strategy inside a week, as last Monday he said the Chequers deal ""means disaster"" for Britain - Downing Street responded to that attack by saying he had offered ""no new ideas"". 'Hurtful analogy' While Mr Javid voiced measured criticism of Mr Johnson, other Tories reacted more angrily to his remarks. Former Army officer and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Tom Tugendhat graphically described the aftermath of a suicide bomb that had gone off near his office in Helmand province, Afghanistan. He said comparing such an attack to the PM's plans ""isn't funny"", adding: ""Some need to grow up"".

The Palestinians are asking the UN General Assembly to upgrade their status from permanent observer to a ""non-member observer state"". Israel and the US oppose the move, due to be voted on later this week. They are concerned that the Palestinians are trying to seek full statehood via the UN, rather than through negotiation as set out in the 1993 Oslo peace accords under which the Palestinian Authority was established. Washington has warned that it could hinder rather than help future dialogue. Britain 'undecided' ""You know that for years and years France's consistent position has been the recognition of the Palestinian state,"" Laurent Fabius told the lower house of parliament. ""That is why when the question is raised on Thursday and Friday, France will respond with a 'yes'."" Backing international recognition of a Palestinian state was a campaign pledge made by Francois Hollande before he became France's president earlier this year. It was a policy first set out by Francois Mitterand in 1982, and has been pursued by Mr Hollande's predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy. However, Mr Fabius cautioned that the vote came at a delicate time - with a recent ""extremely fragile"" ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, looming Israeli elections and a new administration of re-elected US President Barack Obama. ""It's only with negotiations between the two sides that we demand immediately, without any preconditions, that a Palestinian state can become a reality,"" he said. France - a permanent member of the UN Security Council - is the first major European country to come out in favour of the move. Germany is expected to vote against, while the UK's ambassador to the UN, Mark Lyall Grant, said on Tuesday that London remained undecided. According to AFP news agency, Mr Lyall Grant told reporters the UK thought the Palestinians should delay the application, but was still in talks with the Palestinian Authority and would decide ""in due time"" how to vote. Austria says it will also back the Palestinian bid and claims that more than half of the European Union's 27 member states will vote for the proposal, AFP reports.

It became known as the ""hardest day"" as both sides recorded their greatest loss of aircraft during the battle. The Battle of Britain lasted throughout the summer of 1940. It was the first major campaign fought entirely in the air. BBC reporter Clark Ainsworth at Biggin Hill What a sight. Watching those iconic World War Two aircraft take to the skies above Biggin Hill was something to behold. Spectators gasped as they then circled the airfield in formation.

He denies giving Mr Duggan an illegal handgun on 4 August last year. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard he had borrowed a gun for a day, but returned it a week before Mr Duggan was shot. Mr Duggan's death sparked riots in Tottenham, which led to disorder in a number of English cities and towns. Mr Hutchinson-Foster denies selling or transferring a prohibited firearm to Mr Duggan between 28 July and 5 August 2011. Barber 'pistol-whipped' Giving evidence, he said he lied to police when they asked him whether he had handled the gun in the week before Mr Duggan's death because he did not want anyone to think ""I had something to do with Mark dying"". He had used the gun to pistol-whip a barber in a hair salon in Hackney on 29 July and the blood of both men was found on the weapon, the court heard. He said he borrowed the gun ""for show"" in the confrontation with the barber, but returned it later that day. Mr Hutchinson-Foster also said he lied when he told police Mr Duggan had been part of a group of men that beat him with a gun a week earlier. Prosecutor Edward Brown QC, suggested this was an ""invented attack"" to account for the fact that his blood was found on the handgun which police found after Mr Duggan was shot.

A recent EU report criticised the police in Turkey for using excessive force during mass protests in June.

Turkey signed an association agreement with the EU (then the European Economic Community) back in 1963. Over the years negotiations have stalled over a range of issues, including concern over freedom of speech and democracy, treatment of religious minorities, judicial reform, and ongoing tensions with Cyprus, an existing EU member.

The Home Office said the NAO's report highlighted ""the scale and organised nature of the abuse"", adding that 25 people had received criminal convictions for their role in the scandal. In 2014, BBC Panorama broadcast footage showing organised cheating in two English language test centres run by third parties for the non-profit organisation Educational Testing Service (ETS). The service used voice recognition technology to try to find out who had cheated by having someone else sit their test. ETS classified 97% of UK tests taken between 2011 and 2014 as suspicious, 58% as invalid, and 39% as questionable. In the wake of the findings, the Home Office shut down colleges, excluded students and cancelled visas.

This is what we have learnt. The rocket is enormous Many observers have been struck by the missile's vast size - this undated picture released by state media of Mr Kim dwarfed by the rocket he is inspecting gives an idea of its scale. Michael Duitsman, a research associate at the Centre for Nonproliferation Studies, noted that the missile was much bigger than its previous iteration the Hwasong-14, and added: ""Only a few countries can produce missiles of this size, and North Korea just joined the club."" Some have also noted that the rocket appears to have more sophisticated steering and thrusters. The ""new, more capable missile"" seems to have a more powerful propulsion system with two main engines and looks like it can carry more than twice as much propellant, David Wright of the Union of Concerned Scientists told Reuters news agency. It also has a larger and blunter nose cone, which could mean it can carry a ""super-large heavy"" nuclear warhead on its tip, as Pyongyang claims. All this means that the missile appears capable of transporting a nuclear warhead for a long distance and possibly surviving atmospheric re-entry.

It said Serco's were worth £1.8bn, including £611m with the Ministry of Defence and £382m with local government. Capita's totalled £1.08bn, while those for G4S and Atos were £718m and £683m respectively. 'Political fallout' The NAO said the Cabinet Office, which oversees much of central government, often lacked ""commercial experience and expertise below senior levels"", and information on its 40 strategic suppliers was ""inconsistent and incomplete"".

Experts have predicted it is ""highly likely"" the species - known as the Highland tiger - will become extinct without the intervention. EU funding worth £3.2m has been secured to develop a reintroduction centre in the Highland Wildlife Park at Kincraig. The cats will be raised away from public view to minimise interaction with humans before their release. Potential release sites are being explored within the Cairngorms National Park.

The family of Sinclair Upton, who was buried there in 1957, have consented to their plot being excavated. For relatives of Alexander Gartshore, the search may confirm whether the child rapist committed another heinous crime. Moira's tortured family have not known what happened to her since she left her family home in Coatbridge on 23 February 1957. The 11-year-old, who was five weeks short of her 12th birthday, was running an errand for her family to a nearby Co-op store when she vanished during a blizzard. She was last seen on board a bus driven by Gartshore, who was jailed later that year for raping a 17-year-old babysitter. Despite decades of appeals, the schoolgirl was never traced. The case remained cold until 1999, when child abuser James Gallogley named his former friend Gartshore as the murderer.

uk-44307037,"What is contempt of court, and why is Tommy Robinson guilty of it?","Former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson has been sentenced to nine months in prison after being found guilty of ""contempt of court"". What does that mean?","By Clive ColemanLegal correspondent, BBC News What is contempt of court? Contempt of court laws exist to ensure people get fair trials. The idea is that juries must not be influenced by anything but the evidence they hear in court. The rules apply to everyone from journalists to people posting comments on social media, and even jurors. If someone interferes with a trial, the defendants can walk free and a new trial might have to be held. The maximum sentence for contempt of court is two years in prison, but it can also be punished with an unlimited fine. The law is set out in the 1981 Contempt of Court Act. Contempt includes publishing anything that creates a substantial risk of seriously prejudicing ""active"" criminal proceedings. Proceedings become ""active"" when a suspect is arrested. Someone could also be in contempt by actions including taking photographs or film, recording what is said in court or talking to a jury member about a case. Why was Tommy Robinson found guilty of contempt? Tommy Robinson, also known as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, committed contempt of court by broadcasting footage of defendants accused of sexual exploitation. The hour-long broadcast, outside Leeds Crown Court in May 2018, was seen by thousands of people. Lawyers for the Attorney General said reporting restrictions had been put in place. These postponed the publication of any details of the case until the end of a series of linked trials, involving 29 defendants. This was to stop the juries in those cases being influenced. They also said the manner in which Robinson filmed the defendants at court was a problem. The aggressive confrontation could have influenced those on bail not to co-operate with the trial. Judge Dame Victoria Sharp said when explaining the decision, that Mr Robinson encouraged ""vigilante action"" in his Facebook Live. She also said that the video could have ""seriously impeded"" justice over a sexual grooming gang's trial. Robinson was originally jailed for 13 months for the offence in May 2018. But the Court of Appeal said his case hadn't been handled fairly. Then, the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox - the government's top legal adviser - announced that new proceedings could be brought against him. What other famous cases have there been? In 2011, the Sun and the Daily Mail were found guilty of contempt for pictures they published during a murder trial. They had shown the defendant holding a gun, which risked prejudicing the jury. The following year, the Dail"

The BBC said changing the law could lead to more people failing to pay. In 2012 about 155,000 were convicted and fined for not paying the £145.50 fee. In total 180,000 people were prosecuted for not paying their licence - which is needed to watch or record live broadcasts on any device - accounting for more than one in 10 criminal prosecutions that year. In October 2013 Huffington Post reported that in response to a Freedom of Information Request the Ministry of Justice had revealed that 107 people were jailed between January 2011 and March 2013 for failing to pay fines related to not having a TV licence. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has now told the Daily Telegraph ""serious work"" would be done on the proposal to make non-payment a civil offence and that it could ease the pressure on criminal courts. He said: ""The culture secretary and I both agree that this is a really interesting idea - particularly given the pressure on our courts system.

world-42873633,Reality Check: Where are the world's nuclear weapons?,"The Pentagon has outlined how it wants to revamp the US nuclear arsenal, and develop new low-yield bombs, largely in response to the threat from Russia.","By Reality Check teamBBC News Reality Check looks into where the world's nuclear weapons are located and who owns them. While the global stockpile of nuclear weapons has shrunk significantly since the Cold War, there are hundreds of warheads that could be launched at short notice, and experts say every nuclear-armed nation is modernising its arsenal or has plans to do so. Countries keep most details of their nuclear weapons secret, but it is known that nine countries own the estimated more than 9,000 nuclear weapons that are in military service. These are either deployed - mounted on land or sea missiles and kept at air bases - or in storage. About 1800 are on high alert and could be fired with little warning. The US and Russia own the vast majority of the world's nuclear weapons. Including retired warheads waiting to be dismantled, the total is said to be almost 15,000, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). This is a marked decline since the 1980s when the figure peaked at around 70,000. Why only these countries? Since 1970, 190 countries including the US, Russia, UK, France and China have joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). India, Israel and Pakistan never signed the agreement and North Korea left in 2003. The NPT recognises five states having nuclear weapons - US, Russia, France, UK and China - all of which had tested nuclear weapons before the agreement came into effect. Under the agreement, these countries should not maintain an arsenal forever. The treaty prohibits non-recognised states from developing nuclear weapons. South Africa, and former Soviet Union countries Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine have all given up theirs. Are countries making progress on disarmament? The US, UK and Russia have all been reducing the size of their warhead inventories, Israel's and France's are said to be relatively unchanged and China, Pakistan, India and North Korea are believed to producing more, according to the Federation of American Scientists.

Their answer - ""the planetary health diet"" - does not completely banish meat and dairy. But it is recommending we get most of our protein from nuts and legumes (such as beans and lentils) instead. Their diet needs an enormous shift in what we pile on to our plates and for us to turn to foods that we barely eat. What changes am I going to have to make? If you eat meat every day then this is the first biggie. For red meat you're looking at a burger a week or a large steak a month and that's your lot. You can still have a couple of portions of fish and the same of chicken a week, but plants are where the rest of your protein will need to come from. The researchers are recommending nuts and a good helping of legumes every day instead. There's also a major push on all fruit and veg, which should make up half of every plate of food we eat. Although there's a cull on ""starchy vegetables"" such as the humble potato or cassava which is widely eaten in Africa. So what is the diet in detail? If you served it all up this is what you would be allowed each day: The diet has room for 31g of sugar and about 50g worth of oils like olive oil. How do your food choices impact on the environment?

We're not talking about a deprivation diet here, it is healthy eating that is flexible and enjoyable."" Is this for real, or just a fantasy? This plan requires changes to diets in pretty much every corner of the world. Europe and North America need to cut back massively on red meat, East Asia needs to cut back on fish, Africa on starchy vegetables.

Flight Lieutenant Chris Nash, who flew one of the Tucanos into Belfast, explained why it is painted in the Battle of Britain colours of the Spitfire, with Enniskillen written on the fuselage. ""It's to do with the way the Spitfires were financed for 72 Squadron during the Second World War,"" he said.

uk-politics-38628428,Brexit: UK 'could change economic model' if single market access denied,"The UK may be forced to change its ""economic model"" if it is locked out of the single market after Brexit, Chancellor Philip Hammond has said.","Mr Hammond said the government would not ""lie down"" and would ""do whatever we have to do"" to remain competitive. He had been asked by a German newspaper if the UK could become a ""tax haven"" by further lowering corporation tax. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said his comments sounded like ""a recipe for some kind of trade war with Europe"". Having so far refused to offer a ""running commentary"" on her plans, Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to spell out the most detail so far of her Brexit strategy in a speech on Tuesday. Reports have suggested she will signal pulling out of the EU single market and customs union, although Downing Street described this as ""speculation"". In an interview with the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag newspaper, Mr Hammond said he was ""optimistic"" a reciprocal deal on market access could be struck, and that he hoped the UK would ""remain in the mainstream of European economic and social thinking"". ""But if we are forced to be something different, then we will have to become something different,"" he said. ""If we have no access to the European market, if we are closed off, if Britain were to leave the European Union without an agreement on market access, then we could suffer from economic damage at least in the short-term. ""In this case, we could be forced to change our economic model and we will have to change our model to regain competitiveness. And you can be sure we will do whatever we have to do. ""The British people are not going to lie down and say, too bad, we've been wounded. We will change our model, and we will come back, and we will be competitively engaged."" 'Extremely risky' Asked about Mr Hammond's comments during an interview on The Andrew Marr Show Mr Corbyn said ""He appears to be making a sort of threat to EU community saying 'well, if you don't give us exactly what we want, we are going to become this sort of strange entity on shore of Europe where there'll be very low levels of corporate taxation, and designed to undermine the effectiveness or otherwise of industry across Europe.' ""It seems to me a recipe for some kind of trade war with Europe in the future. That really isn't a very sensible way forward."" Mr Corbyn also said Mrs May ""appears to be heading us in the direction of a sort of bargain basement economy"", adding: ""It seems to me an extremely risky strategy.""

entertainment-arts-45395322,Chris Evans: A life in broadcasting,Chris Evans has announced he will be leaving the Radio 2 breakfast show at the end of the year to host Virgin Radio's equivalent.,"His departure will bring an end to the latest chapter in an eventful career that has brought him fame, riches - and some notoriety. Evans built his reputation as a witty prankster on London station GLR, where he started as a producer and ended up as a star DJ. He shot to fame in 1992 as host of The Big Breakfast, a riotous early morning programme on Channel 4. The Big Breakfast was a huge hit in its early days, beating even GMTV when it launched on ITV in 1993. The Warrington-born star's dynamic personality defined the show, which catapulted him from cult personality to national celebrity. Don't Forget Your Toothbrush, his first prime-time TV show, made its debut on Channel 4 in 1994. The format for the show - made by Ginger Productions, his own production outfit - was lucratively sold around the world. After leaving The Big Breakfast in 1994, Evans was recruited by BBC Radio 1 to revamp the station's breakfast show. He accepted on the proviso it would be in the hands of Ginger Productions, an arrangement the BBC was prepared to accept in return for bumper ratings. In 1996 he returned to Channel 4 to launch TFI Friday, a classic Evans cocktail of live music, celebrity chat, outlandish stunts and in-jokes. Yet he found it hard to juggle it with his Radio 1 day job, leading to a parting of the ways in January 1997 when his demands to work a four-day week were refused. ""I was stupid, no doubt about that,"" he admitted in 2009. ""I was ungrateful. I had this brilliant career and messed it up."" Evans was not off air for long. Later that year he returned to breakfast radio, on Sir Richard Branson's Virgin station. He liked the job so much he bought Virgin Radio from Sir Richard at the end of 1997. But the Evans magic started to fade soon afterwards. He was photographed out on the town with Paul Gascoigne, damaging the footballer's chances of getting into the England squad for the 1998 World Cup. TFI Friday started to go off the boil, while two BBC projects, the National Lottery-based Red Alert and student quiz Carry On Campus, flopped. That did not stop him selling his Ginger "
uk-wales-24073302,Archbishop of Wales hopes no one 'lost' over women bishops,"The Archbishop of Wales said he hoped no-one would be ""lost"" from the Church in Wales after its landmark decision to allow women bishops.","Dr Barry Morgan has pledged to talk to those Anglicans who ""find the decision difficult"". The Church's governing body voted overwhelmingly in favour of the change on Thursday. A similar vote in 2008 was narrowly defeated. In England, the issue is due to be discussed again in November. Despite female bishops being allowed in Northern Ireland and Scotland, none have been elected yet. The vote at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David in Lampeter, Ceredigion, led to huge cheers as the result was announced. But it has also led to some traditionalists saying the decision may lead them to consider their future within the Church. Canon Jenny Wigley, Rector of Radyr, whose successful amendment to the bill was instrumental in ensuring the vote had a yes or no outcome, said she hoped women in the Church of England would be encouraged by the result. ""Sisters across Offa's Dyke, look to us,"" she said. 'Promise' The vote leaves the bishops to write a code of practice for those who cannot ""accept the authority of women bishops"". Dr Morgan said: ""I hope it will be possible that no-one will be lost. It's a matter now for discussion. ""I promise on behalf of the bench of bishops that we will talk to a range of people across the Church. ""We'll come back in April to hear what people have to say but in the end the bishops will have to draw up the code of practice."" In the breakdown of the vote, the laity voted 57 for, 14 against,"
uk-politics-55973463,"Covid: 'Clean up' awarding of contracts, says Labour","Labour has challenged the government to ""clean up"" how it awards contracts for Covid work.","In an online speech, shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said procurement during the pandemic had been ""rife with conflicts of interest"". And she called for a new ethics watchdog to ""guarantee standards"" for spending public money. The government said it has ""robust rules and processes"" to ensure that conflicts of interest do not occur. During her speech, Ms Reeves raised questions about contracts awarded to companies that she said have links to the Conservatives. She added that ""cronyism in contracting"" had led to ""unforgivable waste"" and showed the need for tougher transparency rules. It comes after a National Audit Office report last November found that more than half of contracts by the end of July 2020 had been awarded without competitive tender. As the pandemic struck last spring, there was a scramble to ensure that hospitals and other care settings had adequate supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE). The NAO found that companies recommended by MPs, peers and ministers' offices were given priority, and not enough was done to address potential conflicts of interest by ministers and other government officials. However, it concluded that in cases of potential conflicts of interest involving ministers, all had properly declared their interests and it found ""no evidence of their involvement in procurement decisions or contract management"".

uk-38182298,Child car seats: Will you be affected by rule changes?,New rules on child car seats are set to come into force after March next year and have left many parents confused about what they need to use.,"Changes are being made to the weight and height at which a child will be allowed to use a backless booster seat. However, parents will not need to replace car seats they have already bought because they can continue to use them. What is changing? From next year, changes are being made on the rules regarding backless booster seats. Currently, parents can use these types of seats for children who weigh 15kg (2st 5lbs) and above - typically aged three and over. The new rules will mean only children weighing over 22kg (3st 7lbs) who are also over 125cm (4ft 1ins) tall can use the seats. The United Nations, which sets the safety standards for car seats, has approved the change which must now be implemented by the EU. The government said the earliest the new rules will come in is March 2017 and they will affect the whole of the UK. Why bring in the new rules? Many child car seat experts say they are unsuitable for small children as the child is not held as securely in the seat, the adult seatbelt is not guided across their body in the best way and they offer little protection if a car is involved in a side-on crash. What if you have already bought one? Do not worry. The changes will only apply to new backless seats and not ones already on the market that meet current safety standards. Parents can continue to use their current model after the rule change and will not need to buy a n"

JP Morgan is currently in talks with the US government over a potentially huge settlement relating to the sale of mortgage-related investment products in the run-up to the financial crisis. Last month, it paid $920m to settle charges related to a trading scandal. JP Morgan's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said: ""We continuously evaluate our legal reserves, but in this highly charged and unpredictable environment, with escalating demands and penalties from multiple government agencies, we thought it was prudent to significantly strengthen them.""

Wells Fargo, the biggest US mortgage lender, also reported results on Friday. It reported a record net income of $5.3bn in the third quarter, up 13% on the same period in 2012. That rise came despite a fall in income at its mortgage business, where revenue fell 43% to $1.6bn. The fall was offset by lower expenses and a reduction in funds set aside for loans going bad.
