uk-37239256,Thousands of children reported over indecent images,"More than 2,000 children were reported to police in three years over indecent images, the NSPCC says.","THE CHILDREN'S CHARITY SUBMITTED A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST SPANNING 2013-15 TO POLICE ACROSS THE UK. THIS SHOWED 2,031 UNDER-18S WERE REPORTED FOR CRIMES LINKED TO THE POSSESSION, DISTRIBUTION, OR PRODUCTION OF INDECENT IMAGES OF CHILDREN. NSPCC CHIEF EXECUTIVE PETER WANLESS SAID CHILDREN HAD TO BE EDUCATED ABOUT STAYING SAFE BOTH OFFLINE AND ONLINE. THE LAW STATES THAT MAKING OR SHARING INDECENT PHOTOGRAPHS OF ANYONE AGED UNDER THE AGE OF 18 COULD BE CLASSED AS AN OFFENCE - BUT THERE HAVE BEEN CALLS FOR RECORDING RULES TO BE ADAPTED SO CHILDREN ARE NOT ROUTINELY CRIMINALISED. THE NSPCC SENT THE 45 POLICE FORCES ACROSS THE UK AN FOI IN MAY, AND FOUND THE TOTAL OFFENCES OF THIS NATURE RECORDED, REGARDLESS OF AGE, WERE 4,530 IN 2013, 6,303 IN 2014, AND 10,818 IN 2015. NOT ALL POLICE FORCES PROVIDED AGE BREAKDOWNS, BUT FOR THOSE WHICH DID, THERE WERE 11,697 INVESTIGATIONS WHERE THE AGE OF THE DEFENDANT WAS RECORDED AND 2,031 WERE UNDER THE AGE OF 18. IMAGE 'EXPLOSION' THE CHARITY ALSO SAID THAT, OF THE 1,000 PARENTS AND CARERS FROM ACROSS THE UK WHO TOOK PART IN A RECENT ONLINE SURVEY, ONLY HALF OF PARENTS KNEW THAT CHILDREN TAKING NUDE SELFIES WERE COMMITTING A CRIME. MR WANLESS SAID RECENT ADVANCES IN DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY HAS FUELLED AN ""EXPLOSION IN THE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE IMAGES"" THAT INCREASINGLY INVOLVES LIVE VIDEO STREAMING. HE ADDED: ""AS WELL AS PURSUING AND DETERRING ADULTS WHO MAKE AND DISTRIBUTE THESE WE MUST EDUCATE CHILDREN ABOUT HOW TO KEEP THEMSELVES SAFE ONLINE AND OFFLINE AND HOW TO GET HELP AS SOON AS GROOMING OR ABUSE HAPPENS. ""AND EVERY CHILD WHO IS THE VICTIM OF EXPLOITATION AND ABUSE SHOULD GET THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES."" AND HE SAID THAT THE INTERNET INDUSTRY MUST PRIORITISE THIS ISSUE BY WORKING WITH THE PUBLIC AND VOLUNTARY SECTOR. IN SEPTEMBER, THE BBC LEARNED THAT A BOY WHO SENT A NAKED PHOTOGRAPH OF HIMSELF TO A GIRL AT SCHOOL HAD THE CRIME OF MAKING AND DISTRIBUTING INDECENT IMAGES RECORDED AGAINST HIM BY POLICE. THE BOY, AGED 14, WHO WAS NOT ARRESTED OR CHARGED, COULD HAVE HIS NAME STORED ON A POLICE DATABASE FOR 10 YEARS."
science-environment-40889934,Climate change has shifted the timing of European floods,"Climate change has had a significant impact on the timing of river floods across Europe over the past 50 years, according to a new study.","BY MATT MCGRATHENVIRONMENT CORRESPONDENT IN SOME REGIONS, SUCH AS SOUTHERN ENGLAND, FLOODS ARE NOW OCCURRING 15 DAYS EARLIER THAN THEY DID HALF A CENTURY AGO. BUT THE CHANGES AREN'T UNIFORM, WITH RIVERS AROUND THE NORTH SEA SEEING FLOODS DELAYED BY AROUND EIGHT DAYS. THE STUDY HAS BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL SCIENCE. FLOODS CAUSED BY RIVERS IMPACT MORE PEOPLE THAN ANY OTHER NATURAL HAZARD, AND THE ESTIMATED GLOBAL DAMAGES RUN TO OVER A $100BN A YEAR. RESEARCHERS HAVE LONG PREDICTED THAT A WARMING WORLD WOULD HAVE DIRECT IMPACTS ON THESE EVENTS BUT UNTIL NOW THE EVIDENCE HAS BEEN HARD TO ESTABLISH. FLOODS ARE AFFECTED BY MANY DIFFERENT FACTORS IN ADDITION TO RAINFALL, SUCH AS THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE ALREADY IN THE SOIL AND OTHER QUESTIONS SUCH AS CHANGES IN LAND-USE THAT CAN SPEED UP WATER RUN-OFF FROM HILLSIDES. THIS NEW STUDY LOOKS AT THIS ISSUE IN SOME DEPTH, BY CREATING A EUROPE-WIDE DATABASE OF OBSERVATIONS FROM 4,262 HYDROMETRIC STATIONS IN 38 COUNTRIES, DATING BACK TO 1960. THE ANALYSIS FINDS A CLEAR BUT COMPLEX IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON RIVER FLOODING. THE MOST CONSISTENT CHANGES ARE IN NORTH-EASTERN EUROPE AROUND SCANDINAVIA WHERE EARLIER SNOW MELT DUE TO WARMER TEMPERATURES IS LEADING TO EARLIER SPRING FLOODS. AROUND 50% OF MONITORING STATIONS ARE SEEING FLOODS EIGHT DAYS EARLIER THAN THEY DID 50 YEARS AGO. THE BIGGEST CHANGES ARE SEEN ALONG THE WESTERN EDGE OF EUROPE, FROM PORTUGAL UP TO SOUTHERN ENGLAND. HALF THE STATIONS RECORDED FLOODS AT LEAST 15 DAYS EARLIER THAN PREVIOUSLY. A QUARTER OF THE STATIONS SAW FLOODING MORE THAN 36 DAYS EARLIER THAN IN 1960. IN THESE REGIONS, THE ISSUE ISN'T SNOW MELT - IT'S MORE ABOUT SATURATED SOILS. MAXIMUM RAINFALL TENDS TO OCCUR IN THE AUTUMN AND GETS STORED IN THE SOILS. HEAVIER AND EARLIER RAIN MEANS THAT THE GROUNDWATER REACHES CAPACITY EARLIER. ""IT'S THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN EXTREME RAINFALL AND THE ABUNDANCE OF RAINFALL,"" LEAD AUTHOR PROF GÜNTER BLÖSCHL, FROM THE TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF VIENNA, TOLD BBC NEWS. ""IN SOUTHERN ENGLAND, IT HAS BEEN RAINING MORE, LONGER AND MORE INTENSELY THAN IN THE PAST. THIS HAS CREATED A RISING GROUNDWATER TABLE AND HIGHER SOIL MOISTURE THAN USUAL AND COMBINED WITH INTENSE RAINFALL THIS PRODUCES EARLIER RIVER FLOODS."" HOWEVER, AROUND THE NORTH SEA, IN THE NETHERLANDS, DENMARK AND SCOTLAND, THE TREND IS TOWARDS LATER FLOODS. THE SCIENTISTS BELIEVE THIS IS DUE TO CHANGES IN THE NORTH ATLANTIC OSCILLATION (NAO), THE WEATHER PHENOMENON THAT PUSHES STORMS ACROSS THE OCEAN INTO EUROPE. THE NAO IS DRIVEN BY DIFFERENCES IN ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE BETWEEN THE NORTH POLE AND THE EQUATOR. RECENT, RAPID CHANGES IN TEMPERATURES IN THE ARCTIC ARE INTERFERING WITH THESE PRESSURE LEVELS AND CHANGING THE TRACK OF THE OSCILLATION AND STORMS AS WELL. ACCORDING TO THIS STUDY, THE STORMS ARE ARRIVING LATER AND AS A RESULT SOME RIVER FLOODING HAPPENS LATER TOO. PROF BLÖSCHL SAYS THAT THIS STUDY SHOWS CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THE IMPACT OF HUMAN-INDUCED CLIMATE CHANGE IN MANY REGIONS - BUT THERE ARE STILL SOME AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY. ""WHERE THE HUMAN IMPRINT IS OBVIOUS IS IN THE NORTHEAST OF EUROPE. IT IS QUITE A DIRECT LINK, WITH A WARMING CLIMATE AND EARLIER SNOW MELT,"" HE SAID. ""HOWEVER, THE AREAS IMPACTED BY THE NAO ARE MORE DIFFICULT TO ATTRIBUTE TO ANTHROPOGENIC GLOBAL WARMING. THE JURY IS STILL OUT ON THAT ASPECT."" THE STUDY FORESEES SUBTLE BUT SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS THAT COULD ARISE FROM THE CHANGE IN FLOOD TIMING. THERE COULD BE EFFECTS ON RIVER ECOSYSTEMS WITH SALMON SPAWNING LATER IN THE YEAR. THERE COULD ALSO BE IMPLICATIONS FOR HYDROPOWER STATIONS, AND FOR AGRICULTURE IF FIELDS STAY WETTER FOR LONGER. ""THE MORE SERIOUS CONCERN IS THAT IF WARMING IMPACTS THE SEASONALITY IT MAY ALSO IMPACT THE SCALE OF FLOODING,"" SAID PROF BLÖSCHL. ""YOU COULD THINK OF TIMING CHANGES AS THE HARBINGER OF FUTURE CHANGES OF FLOOD MAGNITUDE. THAT IS THE MORE SERIOUS CONCERN. IF THAT HAPPENS, FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT WILL HAVE TO ADAPT AND THAT WILL BE DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF EUROPE."" OTHER EXPERTS BELIEVE THAT THE CHANGES IN FLOOD TIMING IDENTIFIED BY THIS STUDY HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR HOW WE UNDERSTAND THE RISK OF RIVER FLOODS AND HOW WE DEAL WITH THEM. ""NEARLY EVERY MAJOR CITY AND TOWN IN EUROPE IS BUILT ON A RIVER AND WE PROTECT THIS URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE BY USING PAST FLOODS AS A GAUGE OF THE POTENTIAL RISK,"" SAID MARK MASLIN, PROFESSOR OF CLIMATOLOGY AT UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON. ""THE STUDY SHOWS THAT THIS APPROACH UNDERESTIMATES THE RISK, AS CLIMATE CHANGE HAS MADE EUROPEAN FLOODS OCCUR EARLIER IN THE YEAR, INCREASING THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT. ""THIS MEANS ALL THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAVE BUILT TO PROTECT OUR CITIES NEEDS TO BE REVIEWED AS MUCH OF IT WILL BE INADEQUATE TO PROTECT US FROM FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE-INDUCED EXTREME FLOODING.""

IS THAT A COINCIDENCE? HEAD TEACHERS IN THE WORTH LESS? CAMPAIGN OVER SCHOOL FUNDING SHORTAGES SAY THAT IF THE GOVERNMENT IS SERIOUS ABOUT PROMOTING SOCIAL MOBILITY IN EDUCATION, THEN IT NEEDS TO LOOK AT HOW LOW FUNDING SEEMS TO MIRROR LOW MOBILITY. WEST SOMERSET HAS THE LOWEST PLACE ON THE GOVERNMENT'S SOCIAL MOBILITY INDEX - AND IS ALSO ONE OF THE LOWEST-FUNDED AREAS. THE WORTH LESS? CAMPAIGN, WHICH HAS BROUGHT TOGETHER ABOUT 5,000 SCHOOLS OVER THE ISSUE OF FAIR FUNDING, HAS PRODUCED AN ANALYSIS SHOWING THAT A SECONDARY SCHOOL IN WEST SOMERSET WOULD RECEIVE £2M LESS PER YEAR THAN A SIMILAR SIZED SCHOOL IN WESTMINSTER. WESTMINSTER, IN THE TOP 10 FOR FUNDING, IS RATED AS GIVING ITS DISADVANTAGED YOUNG PEOPLE THE HIGHEST CHANCE OF SOCIAL MOBILITY IN THE COUNTRY. AND A KEY ASPECT OF THE SUCCESS OF LONDON'S SCHOOLS HAS BEEN THAT POORER YOUNGSTERS, SUCH AS THOSE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE SCHOOL MEALS, DO MUCH BETTER IN THE CAPITAL THAN ELSEWHERE. FUNDING GAPS OF COURSE, THERE ARE MANY OTHER CROSSWINDS IN SUCH A COMPLEX TOPIC. SCHOOLS IN LONDON GET MORE FUNDING BECAUSE THEY HAVE BIGGER CHALLENGES - EXTRA COSTS BECAUSE OF THEIR LOCATION AND EXTRA DEMANDS, SUCH AS HIGH LEVELS OF DEPRIVATION AND MANY PUPILS SPEAKING ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE. IT HAS OFTEN BEEN CLAIMED THAT LONDON HAS ITS OWN DEMOGRAPHIC MICROCLIMATE, WITH MANY MIGRANT FAMILIES ARRIVING WITH HIGH AMBITIONS FOR THEIR CHILDREN. BUT HEAD TEACHERS ARGUE THAT THERE'S NO ESCAPING THE OVERLAP BETWEEN SOCIAL MOBILITY AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT. NONE OF THE LOWEST-FUNDED 20 AUTHORITIES MAKES IT INTO THE TOP 50 FOR SOCIAL MOBILITY. AND THE TOP 10S FOR FUNDING AND SOCIAL MOBILITY ARE SHUFFLING VERY SIMILAR PACKS. TOP 10 FOR FUNDING TOP 10 FOR SOCIAL MOBILITY JULES WHITE, A HEAD TEACHER FROM WEST SUSSEX WHO HAS CO-ORDINATED THE WORTH LESS? SCHOOL FUNDING CAMPAIGN, IS CALLING FOR A MUCH CLOSER LOOK AT WHAT THE VARIATION IN FUNDING REALLY MEANS FOR THOSE OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL. THE FUNDING GAP BETWEEN WEST SOMERSET AND WESTMINSTER, FOR AN INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL, IS THE EQUIVALENT OF DOZENS OF EXTRA TEACHING STAFF, AFTER-SCHOOL CLUBS, UNIVERSITY LINKS, CAREERS ADVICE AND SUPPORT FOR PUPILS WHO ARE STRUGGLING. AND THESE ARE EXACTLY THE KINDS OF ADDED EXTRAS THAT COULD IMPROVE SOCIAL MOBILITY. MR WHITE, SPEAKING AT A WESTMINSTER EDUCATION FORUM EVENT ON SCHOOL FUNDING, HAS BROKEN DOWN THE FIGURES TO PER-PUPIL SPENDING. BARNSLEY, NEAR THE BOTTOM FOR SOCIAL MOBILITY, HAS £4,729 FOR EACH SECONDARY PUPIL, WHILE HACKNEY, IN THE TOP FIVE FOR SOCIAL MOBILITY, RECEIVES £7,840. HOW MUCH COULD SCHOOLS IN BARNSLEY HELP THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE WITH AN EXTRA £1,000 PER TERM FOR EACH OF THEM? OR WHAT MORE PROGRESS COULD BE SUPPORTED IN OTHER AREAS ON THE BOTTOM RUNGS FOR FUNDING, SUCH AS YORK, LEICESTERSHIRE AND WEST SUSSEX. BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS SUCH A NEAT MATCH BETWEEN FUNDING AND SOCIAL MOBILITY. NOTTINGHAM AND MANCHESTER ARE AMONG AREAS THAT ARE RELATIVELY WELL-FUNDED, BUT DON'T DO PARTICULARLY WELL ON SOCIAL MOBILITY. TIGHTROPE ACT THE WESTMINSTER FORUM ON FUNDING HEARD WARNINGS THAT THE ANSWER WAS NOT TAKING MONEY FROM SCHOOLS IN THE CAPITAL. A CHAIR OF GOVERNORS FROM A SECONDARY SCHOOL IN LAMBETH SAID THAT THE CHANGES PROPOSED IN THE NEW NATIONAL FUNDING FORMULA WOULD LEAVE THEM WITH A BUDGET DEFICIT HEADING TOWARDS £500,000, WHICH COULD ONLY BE RESOLVED BY SIGNIFICANT CUTS IN THE TEACHING STAFF. VALENTINE MULHOLLAND, OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF HEAD TEACHERS, SAID THE FUNDING SQUEEZE HAD ALREADY MEANT THE LOSS OF JOBS FOR TEACHING AND SUPPORT STAFF. AND A STUDY FROM THE NATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH (NFER) SUGGESTED HIGHER SPENDING PARTICULARLY BENEFITED DISADVANTAGED PUPILS. NEW EDUCATION SECRETARY DAMIAN HINDS HAS MADE A PRIORITY OF SOCIAL MOBILITY - BUT HE WILL ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SOME BIG DECISIONS ABOUT THE PRESSURE OVER SCHOOL FUNDING. THE DEPARTMENT FOR EDUCATION HAS CONSISTENTLY ARGUED THAT THERE ARE RECORD LEVELS OF FUNDING - AND THE NFER'S BEN DURBIN AGREED THAT BY INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS, ENGLAND'S SCHOOLS ARE RELATIVELY WELL-FUNDED. THE POLITICAL TIGHTROPE ACT FOR MINISTERS IS TO PUSH MORE CASH TO THE LESS WELL-FUNDED AREAS WITHOUT DAMAGING THOSE SCHOOLS PERFORMING WELL IN BETTER-FUNDED PLACES. BUT THE HEAD TEACHERS ARE ARGUING THAT FUNDING AND SOCIAL MOBILITY SHOULD NO LONGER BE SEEN AS SEPARATE CONVERSATIONS."

THE ONS SAID THE MAIN CAUSES WERE FALLS IN THE PRICES OF AIR FARES, VEHICLES, CLOTHING AND SOCIAL HOUSING RENTS. THE BANK OF ENGLAND SAID LAST WEEK THAT IT EXPECTED INFLATION TO INCREASE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. BY FAR THE LARGEST DOWNWARD EFFECT IN APRIL CAME FROM AIR TRANSPORT, WITH PRICES FALLING BY 14.2%, COMPARED WITH A RISE OF 4.5% BETWEEN THE SAME TWO MONTHS LAST YEAR. THIS WAS INFLUENCED BY THE TIMING OF THE EASTER HOLIDAYS IN MARCH. FARE PRICES INCREASED DRAMATICALLY BETWEEN FEBRUARY AND MARCH THIS YEAR AND THEN FELL SHARPLY IN APRIL. THE PRICE OF CLOTHING AND FOOTWEAR ALSO FELL AS RETAILERS DROPPED PRICES TO TRY TO REVIVE SALES HIT BY LAST MONTH'S COLD WEATHER.

business-26891682,Why bamboo is booming again in Taiwan,"Bamboo is ubiquitous in Chinese culture. Sturdy and tenacious, it symbolises virtue.","BY CINDY SUIBBC, TAIPEI IN FACT, THE PLANT HAS HAD A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE DAILY LIFE, CULTURE AND SPIRITUALITY OF THE CHINESE. IN THE PAST, A WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS WERE MADE FROM BAMBOO - FROM ROOF TILES AND RAFTS, TO SHOES, FURNITURE AND AGRICULTURAL TOOLS. BUT DESPITE THE CLOSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHINESE-SPEAKING SOCIETIES AND THE NATURAL MATERIAL, TAIWAN'S BAMBOO INDUSTRY HAS SUFFERED A DECLINE IN RECENT DECADES. IT NEARLY COLLAPSED BECAUSE OF PEOPLE'S PREFERENCE FOR MORE MODERN-LOOKING PRODUCTS, OR JUST CHEAPER PLASTIC GOODS - AND THE IMPACT OF LESS EXPENSIVE BAMBOO IMPORTS FROM CHINA AND SOUTH EAST ASIA. NOWHERE WAS THIS MORE APPARENT THAN IN CENTRAL TAIWAN'S ZHUSHAN OR ""BAMBOO MOUNTAIN"" TOWN. HUNDREDS OF FAMILIES USED TO MAKE BAMBOO PRODUCTS THERE IN THE CENTRE OF THE COUNTRY'S BAMBOO INDUSTRY. NOW THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT 50. IT'S A TREND REFLECTED IN OTHER PARTS OF TAIWAN - ONLY ABOUT 240 BAMBOO-PRODUCTS BUSINESSES REMAIN ON THE ISLAND. ""IN THE PAST, EVERY PART OF TAIWAN HAD PEOPLE WORKING IN THIS INDUSTRY, BUT OVER THE YEARS, BAMBOO HAS BEEN REPLACED BY PLASTIC OR STEEL TO MAKE ALL SORTS OF PRODUCTS, SUCH AS CLOTHES HANGING POLES, BABY CRIBS, AND FURNITURE,"" SAYS YANG CHUN-HSIEN, DIRECTOR OF THE FORESTRY BUREAU'S REFORESTATION AND PRODUCTION DIVISION. HOWEVER, AN EARTHQUAKE AND STRONG RESOLVE ON THE PART OF THE GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY TO CONTINUE USING BAMBOO HAVE LED TO A REVIVAL AND TRANSFORMATION IN ITS USE. IN RECENT YEARS, BAMBOO HAS BEEN USED TO MAKE ITEMS NEVER BEFORE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PLANT - FROM SHAMPOO AND INSECT REPELLENT, TO SOCKS, GLOVES, AND EVEN ROASTED PEANUTS. THIS REINVENTION OF HOW BAMBOO IS USED HAS MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR THE SMALL FAMILY BUSINESSES WHICH MAKE UP THE INDUSTRY TO STAY ALIVE AND TO START REVERSING THE DECADES OF DECLINE. HEALTH BENEFITS? AT THE HEIGHT OF BAMBOO PRODUCTION IN TAIWAN IN THE 1970S, MORE THAN 13 MILLION STALKS WERE HARVESTED EACH YEAR, AND SALES OF THE STALKS ALONE - NOT INCLUDING THE FINISHED PRODUCTS - AMOUNTED TO $3.5M (£2.1M) PER ANNUM. BUT IN THE PAST DECADE, THE ANNUAL HARVEST AMOUNTED TO ONLY ABOUT 1.67 MILLION STALKS WITH SALES ADDING UP TO JUST $456,000 - A LITTLE OVER 10% OF THE PEAK LEVEL. PRODUCTION AND SALES, HOWEVER, HAVE BEEN STEADILY CLIMBING IN RECENT YEARS. FOLLOWING A DEVASTATING EARTHQUAKE ON 21 SEPTEMBER 1999 CENTRED IN NANTOU COUNTY, WHERE ZHUSHAN LIES, THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO HELP THE LOCAL ECONOMY BY COMMISSIONING THE COUNTRY'S NON-PROFIT INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH INSTITUTE (ITRI) TO FIND NEW WAYS TO HELP THE BAMBOO INDUSTRY GROW. ITRI DEVELOPED A METHOD TO CARBONISE BAMBOO STALKS TO PRODUCE HIGH QUALITY BAMBOO CHARCOAL, WHICH HAS A MULTITUDE OF DIFFERENT USES. NATURALLY INSULATING, THE CHARCOAL CAN BE TURNED INTO FIBRES AND WOVEN INTO FABRIC TO MAKE HATS, SCARVES, GLOVES, SOCKS AND PANTS. ALSO SAID TO BE HEALTH GIVING, IT IS INCREASINGLY ADDED TO BODYCARE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS SKIN CREAMS. MEANWHILE, IN INDUSTRY IT IS USED TO PURIFY WATER AND AIR. YET ITS MOST UNUSUAL APPLICATION HAS TO BE IN THE PRODUCTION OF BAMBOO CHARCOAL-COATED PEANUTS - WHICH LOOK EXACTLY AS THEY SOUND - PEANUTS COVERED WITH CHARCOAL. MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER TASTED THEM ARE QUEASY ABOUT GIVING THEM A TRY, BUT THEY ACTUALLY TASTE GOOD, NOT AT ALL LIKE CHARCOAL, AND ARE BELIEVED TO HAVE HEALTH BENEFITS. SUCH DIVERSIFICATION HAS BOUGHT NEW HOPE TO TAIWAN'S BAMBOO INDUSTRY. ""WHEN I WAS GROWING UP, THE TOYS WE PLAYED WITH WERE MADE OF BAMBOO,"" SAYS CHEN CHING-FU, GENERAL MANAGER OF THE BAMBOO CULTURE PARK IN ZHUSHAN - A MANUFACTURER OF BAMBOO PRODUCT, AND THE FIRST VISITOR ATTRACTION IN TAIWAN DEVOTED TO THE PLANT. ""BAMBOO WAS ALL AROUND US, BUT NEVER DID WE IMAGINE BAMBOO CAN BE USED TO MAKE SO MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF PRODUCTS."" LIKE OTHER BUSINESSES, MR CHEN'S NOW SELLS NOT ONLY TRADITIONAL BAMBOO FURNITURE, BUT OTHER PRODUCTS SUCH AS AIR FRESHENERS AND CLOTHING. BESIDES BAMBOO CHARCOAL, THE TAIWANESE HAVE ALSO FOUND WAYS TO USE THE ACTUAL BAMBOO TO MAKE A MUCH WIDER VARIETY OF PRODUCTS THAN THEIR ANCESTORS DID, INCLUDING FLOOR PANELS, PENS, CLOTHES HANGERS AND EVEN LAPTOP CASINGS. SALES OF GOODS MADE FROM ALL FORMS OF BAMBOO IN TAIWAN NOW REACH $100M, WITH EXPORTS INCREASING ALONGSIDE DOMESTIC SALES. NEW SPIN ONE OF THE TRENDS HELPING TO DRIVE THE REVIVAL OF THE INDUSTRY IS THE RETURN OF SECOND OR THIRD GENERATION YOUNG PEOPLE TO HELP RUN FAMILY BUSINESSES. LIN LI-WEI, 36, WORKED AT A POST OFFICE IN THE CAPITAL TAIPEI AFTER GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE. BUT, MAKING ONLY ABOUT $600 A MONTH, HE CAME BACK TO ASSIST HIS FATHER, WHO MADE BAMBOO EAR DIGGERS USED BY CHINESE AND JAPANESE PEOPLE TO REMOVE EARWAX. HE'S NOW PUT A NEW SPIN ON THE FAMILY BUSINESS - MAKING MODERN LOOKING CLOCKS, LAMPS AND WALL LIGHTS OUT OF BAMBOO. HE HAS BEEN RECEIVING ORDERS FOR HIS CREATIONS. ""MY FATHER SUPPORTS ME TRYING TO INNOVATE,"" SAYS MR LIN. ""ONLY THROUGH INNOVATIONS CAN WE ADD VALUE TO OUR PRODUCTS AND CONTINUE OUR BUSINESS."" NOW HE AND HIS FATHER MAKE $5,000 A MONTH. MANY OF THE MANUFACTURERS IN ZHUSHAN ARE BREAKING EVEN, BUT NOT MAKING BIG PROFITS. STILL, THEY PERSEVERE, SEEING IT AS THEIR MISSION TO CONTINUE TO PROMOTE THE USE OF BAMBOO. BAMBOO GROWS FAST - JUST FIVE YEARS TO REACH MATURITY, MAKING IT ONE OF THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY PLANTS TO USE. SO GROWERS AND INDUSTRY LEADERS HOPE THEY CAN REPLACE THE USE OF MANY TYPES OF OTHER WOOD, AND PLASTIC. ""PLASTIC IS VERY CHEAP AND CAN BE USED FOR A LONGER TIME, BUT WHAT A SHAME. BAMBOO IS MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY, NO CHEMICALS ARE USED TO MAKE BAMBOO PRODUCTS, AND THE TREES GROW WITHOUT THE NEED FOR FERTILISER OR PESTICIDES,"" SAID THE FORESTRY BUREAU'S MR YANG. ""BAMBOO CAN ALSO ABSORB A LOT OF CARBON DIOXIDE AND CAN REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES."" BACK AT THE BAMBOO CULTURE PARK, MR CHEN HAS CREATED A DO-IT-YOURSELF WORKSHOP WHERE SCHOOLCHILDREN AND OTHER TOURISTS CAN LEARN HOW BAMBOO CHARCOAL IS MADE AND MAKE THEIR OWN BAMBOO PRODUCTS. ""TAIWAN CAN'T BE WITHOUT BAMBOO BECAUSE IT'S A MATERIAL WE'VE RELIED ON FOR GENERATIONS,"" SAYS MR CHEN. ""I WANT TO HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE AND BENEFITS OF USING BAMBOO.""

PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD URGED PROTESTERS TO MARCH ON THE CAPITOL AFTER MAKING FALSE CLAIMS OF ELECTORAL FRAUD. MS PATEL SAID THE PRESIDENT'S WORDS HAD FUELLED THE VIOLENCE AND HE ""DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO DE-ESCALATE THAT"". EARLIER, PRIME MINISTER BORIS JOHNSON CONDEMNED THE ""DISGRACEFUL SCENES"" AND CALLED FOR A ""PEACEFUL AND ORDERLY TRANSFER OF POWER"". MR TRUMP HAS SINCE SAID THERE WILL BE AN ""ORDERLY TRANSITION"" TO DEMOCRAT JOE BIDEN, WHOSE NOVEMBER ELECTION VICTORY HAS NOW BEEN CERTIFIED BY US LAWMAKERS. BUT HE ADDED THAT HE CONTINUED TO ""TOTALLY DISAGREE"" WITH THE OUTCOME OF THE VOTE, REPEATING HIS UNSUBSTANTIATED CLAIMS OF ELECTORAL FRAUD. 'AWFUL BEYOND WORDS' HUNDREDS OF THE PRESIDENT'S SUPPORTERS STORMED THE CAPITOL - WHERE LAWMAKERS WERE MEETING TO CONFIRM MR BIDEN'S ELECTION VICTORY - AND STAGED AN OCCUPATION OF THE BUILDING IN WASHINGTON DC. BOTH CHAMBERS OF CONGRESS WERE FORCED INTO RECESS, AS PROTESTERS CLASHED WITH POLICE AND TEAR GAS WAS RELEASED. MS PATEL TOLD BBC BREAKFAST THE SCENES WERE ""AWFUL BEYOND WORDS"". THE HOME SECRETARY SAID: ""HIS COMMENTS DIRECTLY LED TO THE VIOLENCE, AND SO FAR HE HAS FAILED TO CONDEMN THAT VIOLENCE AND THAT IS COMPLETELY WRONG."" SHE ADDED: ""HE BASICALLY HAS MADE A NUMBER OF COMMENTS YESTERDAY THAT HELPED TO FUEL THAT VIOLENCE AND HE DIDN'T ACTUALLY DO ANYTHING TO DE-ESCALATE THAT WHATSOEVER... WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE."" THE HOME SECRETARY ADDED THAT AMERICA ""NEEDS TO MOVE ON"" AND HAVE THE TRANSITION OF POWER FROM MR TRUMP TO MR BIDEN. A WOMAN DIED AFTER BEING SHOT BY POLICE, AND THREE OTHERS DIED AS A RESULT OF ""MEDICAL EMERGENCIES"", LOCAL POLICE SAID. POLITICIANS ACROSS THE UK'S POLITICAL PARTIES LINED UP TO CONDEMN THE SCENES IN WASHINGTON. MR JOHNSON TWEETED: ""THE UNITED STATES STANDS FOR DEMOCRACY AROUND THE WORLD AND IT IS NOW VITAL THAT THERE SHOULD BE A PEACEFUL AND ORDERLY TRANSFER OF POWER."" LABOUR LEADER SIR KEIR STARMER SAID IT WAS A ""DIRECT ATTACK ON DEMOCRACY,"" WHILST SCOTTISH FIRST MINISTER NICOLA STURGEON CALLED THE EVENTS ""UTTERLY HORRIFYING"". FOREIGN SECRETARY DOMINIC RAAB SAID THERE WAS ""NO JUSTIFICATION FOR THESE VIOLENT ATTEMPTS TO FRUSTRATE THE LAWFUL AND PROPER TRANSITION OF POWER"". BUT SENIOR WELSH CONSERVATIVE ANDREW RT DAVIES HAS BEEN CRITICISED AFTER COMPARING THE RIOTING TO POLITICIANS WHO SUPPORTED A SECOND REFERENDUM ON BREXIT. MR DAVIES, A MEMBER OF THE WELSH PARLIAMENT, LATER TWEETED THAT ""VIOLENCE MUST NEVER BE TOLERATED"". FRIEND OF PRESIDENT TRUMP AND LEADER OF REFORM UK - FORMERLY THE BREXIT PARTY - NIGEL FARAGE TWEETED: ""STORMING CAPITOL HILL IS WRONG. THE PROTESTERS MUST LEAVE."" PRESIDENT TRUMP LATER CALLED ON HIS SUPPORTERS TO ""GO HOME"", WHILE CONTINUING TO MAKE FALSE CLAIMS OF ELECTORAL FRAUD. TWITTER AND FACEBOOK LATER FROZE HIS ACCOUNTS. MEANWHILE, WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY THERESE COFFEY HAS DEFENDED THE PRIME MINISTER'S RESPONSE TO THE RIOTING. ASKED ON ITV'S PESTON PROGRAMME WHY MR JOHNSON HADN'T CRITICISED MR TRUMP, SHE SAID: ""THE PRIME MINISTER HAS BEEN CLEAR TONIGHT THAT WE NEED A PEACEFUL AND ORDERLY TRANSITION."" IT IS A TRUISM OF BRITISH DIPLOMACY THAT EVERY OCCUPANT OF 10 DOWNING STREET HAS TO GET ON WITH EVERY OCCUPANT OF 1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, REGARDLESS OF THEIR POLITICS OR CHARACTER. PERSONAL CONSIDERATION IS PUSHED ASIDE. WHAT MATTERS IS THE NATIONAL INTEREST AND STAYING CLOSE TO ONE OF BRITAIN'S CLOSEST ALLIES. THUS EVEN NOW, EVEN AFTER DONALD TRUMP'S INCITEMENT OF THE CAPITOL MOB, EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE LESS THAN TWO WEEKS UNTIL THE INAUGURATION, EVEN AS CLOSE REPUBLICAN ALLIES JUMP SHIP, BORIS JOHNSON AND DOMINIC RAAB WERE RELUCTANT TO CRITICISE THE PRESIDENT BY NAME IN THEIR INITIAL RESPONSE OVERNIGHT. YES, THEY CONDEMNED THE VIOLENCE. BUT OF MR TRUMP, NOT A WORD. THIS CAUTION WAS MATCHED BY THE PRIME MINISTERS OF FELLOW SO-CALLED FIVE EYES INTELLIGENCE ALLIES, AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND, BOTH OF WHOM ALSO BOTH FAILED TO MENTION MR TRUMP IN THEIR CONDEMNATORY TWEETS. IN CONTRAST, EUROPEAN LEADERS WERE QUICK TO BLAME THE PRESIDENT PERSONALLY. IT WAS ONLY THIS MORNING THAT A BRITISH MINISTER, HOME SECRETARY PRITI PATEL, FELT ABLE TO FOLLOW SUIT IN STRONG TERMS. SO WAS THIS NATURAL AND SENSIBLE DIPLOMATIC CAUTION IN THE MIDST OF A FEBRILE CRISIS? OR WAS THIS, AS SOME LABOUR FIGURES ARE ALREADY CLAIMING, A FUNCTION OF THE CLOSENESS BETWEEN THE CURRENT UK GOVERNMENT AND THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION? IT WAS ONLY A FEW WEEKS AGO THAT THE DEFENCE SECRETARY, BEN WALLACE, TOLD THE SUN THAT HE WOULD MISS DONALD TRUMP BECAUSE HE WAS A GOOD FRIEND TO BRITAIN. WHATEVER ONE'S VIEWS, IT IS CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT IS SEEN ON THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE BY SOME HAS HAVING IDEOLOGICAL PROXIMITY TO MR TRUMP. CHANGING THAT REPUTATION IS SEEN BY MANY DIPLOMATS AS A PRIORITY IN THE MONTHS AHEAD, A TASK MADE MORE URGENT BY EVENTS OVERNIGHT."

AN EXPERT WITNESS SAID IT WAS THE ""WORST"" CASE HE HAD EVER SEEN MCDONNELL NOT ONLY CARRIED OUT SUBSTANDARD WORK HE CONNED HIS VICTIMS WITH FAKE CLAIMS THAT IT HAD PASSED BUILDING INSPECTIONS WHEN NONE HAD TAKEN PLACE.

WRITING IN THE SAME PAPER, THE CURRENT FOREIGN SECRETARY JEREMY HUNT CALLED FOR PEOPLE TO RALLY BEHIND MRS MAY, BACKING HER TO HOLD THE LINE ""IN THE FACE OF INTENSE PRESSURE"". THE UK IS LEAVING THE EU ON 29 MARCH 2019, AND THE GOVERNMENT'S PLAN - AGREED AT CHEQUERS IN JULY - HAS SPARKED CRITICISM FROM BREXITEER TORIES AS WELL AS THE EU. IN HIS ARTICLE, MR JOHNSON ACCUSED THE EU OF ""BULLYING"" THE UK - BUT QUESTIONED WHY THE RESPONSE HAD BEEN ""SO UTTERLY FEEBLE"". HE SAID THAT RATHER THAN GETTING A ""GENEROUS FREE TRADE DEAL"", BRITAIN IS SAYING, ""YES SIR, NO SIR, THREE BAGS FULL SIR"", TO BRUSSELS. ""AT EVERY STAGE OF THE TALKS SO FAR, BRUSSELS GETS WHAT BRUSSELS WANTS,"" WROTE MR JOHNSON. ""IT IS A HUMILIATION. WE LOOK LIKE A SEVEN-STONE WEAKLING BEING COMICALLY BENT OUT OF SHAPE BY A 500LB GORILLA."" HE SAID THE REASON FOR THE UK'S RESPONSE WAS THE ""INSANITY OF THE SO-CALLED BACKSTOP"" - THE COMMITMENT BY THE UK AND THE EU TO COME UP WITH A SOLUTION TO AVOID A HARD BORDER IN NORTHERN IRELAND. HOWEVER, HIS CALL TO SCRAP THE PROPOSED BACKSTOP HAS BEEN HEAVILY CRITICISED BY SINN FÉIN AND THE SDLP. SINN FEIN SAID MR JOHNSON'S COMMENTS WERE ""FOOLISH AND DANGEROUS"", WHILE THE SDLP SAID HE HAD ""ABSOLUTELY NO REGARD FOR PEOPLE ON THIS ISLAND"". THE BBC'S POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT ALEX FORSYTH SAID THE ""SCATHING REMARKS"" BY MR JOHNSON SHOWED HIS ""WILLINGNESS TO CHALLENGE THE PRIME MINISTER REMAINS UNDIMMED"" AFTER RECENT REVELATIONS ABOUT HIS PRIVATE LIFE.

world-europe-20514194,France to back Palestinian bid for UN status,France has confirmed it intends to vote for Palestinian non-member status at the United Nations later this week.,"FOREIGN MINISTER LAURENT FABIUS SAID FRANCE HAD LONG BACKED PALESTINIAN AMBITIONS FOR STATEHOOD AND WOULD VOTE YES ""OUT OF A CONCERN FOR COHERENCY"". THE PALESTINIANS ARE ASKING THE UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO UPGRADE THEIR STATUS FROM PERMANENT OBSERVER TO A ""NON-MEMBER OBSERVER STATE"". ISRAEL AND THE US OPPOSE THE MOVE, DUE TO BE VOTED ON LATER THIS WEEK. THEY ARE CONCERNED THAT THE PALESTINIANS ARE TRYING TO SEEK FULL STATEHOOD VIA THE UN, RATHER THAN THROUGH NEGOTIATION AS SET OUT IN THE 1993 OSLO PEACE ACCORDS UNDER WHICH THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY WAS ESTABLISHED. WASHINGTON HAS WARNED THAT IT COULD HINDER RATHER THAN HELP FUTURE DIALOGUE. BRITAIN 'UNDECIDED' ""YOU KNOW THAT FOR YEARS AND YEARS FRANCE'S CONSISTENT POSITION HAS BEEN THE RECOGNITION OF THE PALESTINIAN STATE,"" LAURENT FABIUS TOLD THE LOWER HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT. ""THAT IS WHY WHEN THE QUESTION IS RAISED ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY, FRANCE WILL RESPOND WITH A 'YES'."" BACKING INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION OF A PALESTINIAN STATE WAS A CAMPAIGN PLEDGE MADE BY FRANCOIS HOLLANDE BEFORE HE BECAME FRANCE'S PRESIDENT EARLIER THIS YEAR. IT WAS A POLICY FIRST SET OUT BY FRANCOIS MITTERAND IN 1982, AND HAS BEEN PURSUED BY MR HOLLANDE'S PREDECESSOR NICOLAS SARKOZY. HOWEVER, MR FABIUS CAUTIONED THAT THE VOTE CAME AT A DELICATE TIME - WITH A RECENT ""EXTREMELY FRAGILE"" CEASEFIRE BETWEEN ISRAEL AND HAMAS, LOOMING ISRAELI ELECTIONS AND A NEW ADMINISTRATION OF RE-ELECTED US PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. ""IT'S ONLY WITH NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO SIDES THAT WE DEMAND IMMEDIATELY, WITHOUT ANY PRECONDITIONS, THAT A PALESTINIAN STATE CAN BECOME A REALITY,"" HE SAID. FRANCE - A PERMANENT MEMBER OF THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL - IS THE FIRST MAJOR EUROPEAN COUNTRY TO COME OUT IN FAVOUR OF THE MOVE. GERMANY IS EXPECTED TO VOTE AGAINST, WHILE THE UK'S AMBASSADOR TO THE UN, MARK LYALL GRANT, SAID ON TUESDAY THAT LONDON REMAINED UNDECIDED. ACCORDING TO AFP NEWS AGENCY, MR LYALL GRANT TOLD REPORTERS THE UK THOUGHT THE PALESTINIANS SHOULD DELAY THE APPLICATION, BUT WAS STILL IN TALKS WITH THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY AND WOULD DECIDE ""IN DUE TIME"" HOW TO VOTE. AUSTRIA SAYS IT WILL ALSO BACK THE PALESTINIAN BID AND CLAIMS THAT MORE THAN HALF OF THE EUROPEAN UNION'S 27 MEMBER STATES WILL VOTE FOR THE PROPOSAL, AFP REPORTS. OBSERVERS SAY THE APPLICATION IS LIKELY WIN APPROVAL IN THE 193-MEMBER UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY, AS IT NEEDS ONLY A SIMPLE MAJORITY TO PASS. ACCORDING TO THE PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANISATION (PLO), MORE THAN 130 COUNTRIES ALREADY GRANT THE PALESTINIANS THE RANK OF A SOVEREIGN STATE. 'UNILATERAL STEPS' AN UPGRADE IN STATUS WOULD ALLOW THE PALESTINIANS TO PARTICIPATE IN GENERAL ASSEMBLY DEBATES AND IMPROVE THEIR CHANCES OF JOINING UN AGENCIES AND THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT (ICC), ALTHOUGH THE PROCESS WOULD BE NEITHER AUTOMATIC NOR GUARANTEED. IF THEY ARE ALLOWED TO SIGN THE ICC'S FOUNDING TREATY, THE ROME STATUTE, THE PALESTINIANS HOPE TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION IN THE COURT TO CHALLENGE ISRAEL'S OCCUPATION OF THE WEST BANK. THE BID FOLLOWS A FAILED ATTEMPT IN 2011 BY MAHMOUD ABBAS, THE PRESIDENT OF THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY AND CHAIRMAN OF THE PLO, TO JOIN THE UN AS A FULL MEMBER STATE. THE PROPOSAL FAILED BECAUSE OF A LACK OF SUPPORT IN THE SECURITY COUNCIL. AS WELL AS SEEKING TO BECOME A NON-MEMBER OBSERVER STATE, THE LATEST PALESTINIAN RESOLUTION ALSO CALLS FOR A MIDDLE EAST SETTLEMENT THAT ""FULFILS THE VISION OF TWO STATES, AN INDEPENDENT, SOVEREIGN, DEMOCRATIC, CONTIGUOUS AND VIABLE STATE OF PALESTINE, LIVING SIDE-BY-SIDE IN PEACE AND SECURITY WITH ISRAEL, ON THE BASIS OF THE PRE-1967 BORDERS."" ISRAEL OPPOSES ANY PULL-BACK TO THE 1967 LINES. ISRAELI FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN LIOR BEN DOR TOLD THE BBC EARLIER THIS MONTH THAT PRESIDENT ABBAS WOULD BE IN BREACH OF THE OSLO PEACE ACCORDS IF HE CONTINUED TO PRESS FOR UN RECOGNITION. AND HE WARNED THAT IF THE PALESTINIANS SOUGHT TO ASK THE ICC TO RESOLVE DISPUTES WITH ISRAEL, THEN ISRAEL WOULD ""TAKE UNILATERAL STEPS TO PROTECT ITS INTERESTS"". HE DID NOT ELABORATE ON WHAT THOSE MEASURES WOULD BE, BUT REPORTS IN THE ISRAELI MEDIA SUGGESTED THEY MIGHT INCLUDE HALTING THE TRANSFER OF TAX REVENUE TO THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY AND RESTRICTING THE MOVEMENT OF PALESTINIAN OFFICIALS THROUGH THE WEST BANK. PRESIDENT ABBAS HAS SAID HE DOES NOT ""WANT ANY CONFRONTATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES OR ISRAEL"", ADDING: ""IF WE CAN START A DIALOGUE OR NEGOTIATIONS THE DAY AFTER THE [UN] VOTE, WE WILL."" THE PALESTINIANS HAVE LONG SOUGHT TO ESTABLISH AN INDEPENDENT, SOVEREIGN STATE IN THE WEST BANK, INCLUDING EAST JERUSALEM, AND THE GAZA STRIP. HOWEVER, TWO DECADES OF ON-AND-OFF PEACE TALKS HAVE FAILED. THE LATEST ROUND OF NEGOTIATIONS BROKE DOWN IN LATE 2010 OVER THE ISSUE OF JEWISH SETTLEMENT BUILDING IN THE WEST BANK AND EAST JERUSALEM. ATTEMPTS TO RESTART DIRECT TALKS HAVE FAILED."

A CLUSTER OF SIX OTHER HOSPITALS - INCLUDING BRISTOL ROYAL INFIRMARY - OPERATE AS MAJOR TRAUMA UNITS IN A NETWORK AROUND IT. BUT SOUTHMEAD, ONE OF 27 MTCS ACROSS ENGLAND, IS IN LINE TO TAKE THE MOST CRITICAL CASES FIRST - INVOLVING UP TO 1,500 PATIENTS A YEAR. DR BEN WALTON, CONSULTANT IN INTENSIVE CARE MEDICINE, SAID IT OFFERED A CONSISTENCY OF SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT POSSIBLE BEFORE. ""THE FEELING WHEN THESE CENTRES WERE FIRST SET UP IN LONDON IT WOULD TAKE FIVE YEARS TO SEE IMPROVEMENTS - WE'VE SEEN IT IN 18 MONTHS,"" HE SAID. ""IN THE PAST, IF A PATIENT WAS SERIOUSLY INJURED IN A ROAD TRAFFIC COLLISION OR FELL AT HOME, THEY'D BE TAKEN TO THE NEAREST HOSPITAL WITH AN EMERGENCY UNIT. ""NOW, IF THEY FULFIL CERTAIN CRITERIA AND THE ASSESSMENT OF THE AMBULANCE OR PRE-HOSPITAL DOCTOR CREW IS THAT THEY'RE LIKELY TO HAVE A SERIOUS INJURY, THEY WILL BY-PASS THEIR NEAREST EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND BE TRANSFERRED DIRECTLY TO THE MAJOR TRAUMA CENTRE."" DR WALTON SAID THE MAJOR TRAUMA CENTRE COULD GATHER TOGETHER MULTIPLE SPECIALISTS AROUND THE CLOCK AND DEAL WITH INJURIES WHICH ARE OFTEN COMPLEX. ""PATIENTS ARE MET BY A TRAUMA TEAM WHICH IS 24/7, 365 DAYS OF THE YEAR AND THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A SENIOR CLINICIAN - A CONSULTANT - LEADING THAT TEAM. ""THAT'S OF BENEFIT TO PATIENTS AND CAN'T BE PROVIDED AT EVERY HOSPITAL, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE."" THERE IS A FLOW OF PATIENTS BETWEEN THE OTHER TRAUMA UNITS AND THE MTC, DEPENDING ON THE SERIOUSNESS OF THEIR CONDITION AND STAGE OF THEIR CARE. BUT DR WALTON SAID: ""I THINK THERE'S NO DOUBT THE REHABILITATION OF PATIENTS IN OUR NETWORK IS PATCHY. THERE'S NOT A JOINED UP, CONSISTENT SERVICE."" MAJOR TRAUMA ALSO WENT BEYOND ROAD CRASHES ""PEOPLE FALLING OR BEING SHOT OR STABBED"".

BALDWIN STREET, KING STREET AND ALL ROADS IN THE OLD CITY WILL BE CLOSED DURING CAR-FREE SUNDAYS. MR FERGUSON SAID FIVE DAYS WERE PLANNED THIS SUMMER, WITH THE FIRST ON 23 JUNE. THE £195,000 COST COVERS ALL FIVE DAYS. 'SUCK IT AND SEE' HE SAID HE HAD BEEN INSPIRED BY SIMILAR SCHEMES IN BORDEAUX IN FRANCE AND BOGOTA IN COLOMBIA.

A JURY WAS SWORN IN EARLIER AS THE INQUESTS REOPENED AFTER A LONG FIGHT BY FAMILIES. PAUL ANTHONY BRIDGEWATER AND MICHELLE SEALEY ARE AMONG RELATIVES ATTENDING. MR BRIDGEWATER, WHOSE FATHER PAUL ANTHONY DAVIES DIED IN THE BOMBINGS, SAID: ""THE CORONER HAS RULED OUT A LOT OF THINGS BUT WE WANT THE TRUTH REALLY. ""WE WANT THE TRUTH AND WE WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BACK THEN. IT'S BEEN TOO LONG AND THERE'S THAT MANY THEORIES OUT THERE AND UNANSWERED QUESTIONS AS WELL."" CORONER SIR PETER THORNTON SAID THE JURY OF SIX WOMEN AND FIVE MEN HAD AN ""IMPORTANT CIVIC DUTY"" AS HE ADJOURNED THE INQUESTS UNTIL TUESDAY. THE INDIVIDUAL INQUESTS COULD LAST UP TO SIX WEEKS, THE CORONER SAID. THE JURY WILL RETURN VERDICTS ON HOW ALL VICTIMS DIED. THE HEARINGS BEGAN WITH A MINUTE'S SILENCE. SIR PETER SAID THE INQUESTS WOULD NOT DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF WHO PLANTED THE BOMBS, ADDING THAT WAS A ""TASK OF POLICE, PROSECUTORS AND THE CRIMINAL COURTS"". HE SAID ALTHOUGH A SINGLE HEARING, LASTING UP TO SIX WEEKS, THE INQUESTS WOULD DEAL WITH ""21 SEPARATE PEOPLE, 21 SEPARATE LIVES LOST FROM TWO TERRIBLE EVENTS"". JURORS, SITTING AT BIRMINGHAM CIVIL JUSTICE CENTRE, WERE TOLD THEY WOULD HEAR EVIDENCE FROM ONLY A FEW EYEWITNESSES BECAUSE SOME WERE ""NO LONGER ALIVE"". SIR PETER ADDED: ""THEY WILL BE DOING THEIR BEST TO RECOLLECT EVENTS ACCURATELY, BUT WE ALL KNOW MEMORY WILL SOMETIMES HAVE GAPS."" HE SAID THERE WOULD BE DETAILS OF THE SO-CALLED ""FOREWARNING ISSUE"", AND EVIDENCE THE BRITISH AUTHORITIES MAY HAVE RECEIVED INFORMATION SIGNALLING THE ATTACKS, INCLUDING AN ALLEGED TIP-OFF CONCERNING A ""POSSIBLE CONVERSATION IN A LOCAL PRISON NEARLY TWO WEEKS BEFORE"". JURORS WOULD ALSO HEAR AN ACCOUNT OF ""EVIDENCE OF A STUDENTS' VISIT TO A POLICE STATION THE EVENING OF THE BOMBINGS, WHICH WAS CANCELLED"", SIR PETER SAID. MR BRIDGEWATER SAID THE LOVED ONES OF VICTIMS HAD FORMED CLOSE BONDS. HE SAID: ""WE ARE A LIKE A CLOSE-KNIT FAMILY AND THAT'S WHAT BONDS US AND KEEPS US STRONG."" HIS SISTER MS SEALEY ADDED: ""IT'S THE KNOCKBACKS THAT MAKE YOU WANT TO PUSH FORWARD EVEN MORE BECAUSE THERE IS SOMETHING THERE THAT WE NEED TO FIND OUT."" INQUESTS WERE OPENED DAYS AFTER THE BOMBINGS BUT ADJOURNED BECAUSE THE CASE WAS SUBJECT TO A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. THE BIRMINGHAM SIX WERE JAILED FOR THE MURDERS AND SERVED 17 YEARS BEHIND BARS BEFORE THEIR CONVICTIONS WERE QUASHED. DESPITE THE SUBSEQUENT OVERTURNING OF THE VERDICTS, THE INQUESTS WERE NEVER REOPENED. FRESH INQUESTS WERE ORDERED IN 2016 BUT DELAYED BECAUSE VICTIMS' FAMILIES DISAGREED WITH THE CORONER, WHO RULED OUT NAMING THOSE SUSPECTED OF CARRYING OUT THE BOMBINGS. BUT THE COURT OF APPEAL IN SEPTEMBER UPHELD THE CORONER'S DECISION. GEORGE JONES, WHO LOST HIS FATHER JOHN CLIFFORD JONES, TOLD THE BBC HE HOPED THE REMIT OF THE INQUESTS WOULD HAVE BEEN BROADER. ""IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER A LOT OF QUESTIONS BUT MY OWN FEELINGS AND THOSE OF MOST OF US IS THOSE AVENUES HAVE BEEN CUT OFF BY THE CORONER'S DECISION OF NARROWING THE SCOPE,"" HE SAID. PAUL BODMAN, WHOSE FATHER STANLEY DIED, DESCRIBED THE HEARINGS AS ""A TICK-BOX EXERCISE"".

HEARINGS WILL CONTINUE ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY WITH PEN PORTRAITS OF EACH OF THE VICTIMS, WHILE ON THURSDAY, THE JURORS WILL BE TAKEN TO THE FORMER SITES OF THE PUBS. SIR PETER IS DUE TO GIVE HIS CLOSING ADDRESS ON 28 MARCH BEFORE THE JURY'S DELIBERATIONS START THE NEXT DAY. ANALYSIS BY MIDLANDS CORRESPONDENT SIMA KOTECHA TODAY MARKS A SIGNIFICANT MOMENT IN THIS LONG RUNNING STORY. THESE ATTACKS ON BIRMINGHAM HAPPENED MORE THAN FOUR DECADES AGO - AND STILL THE FAMILIES OF THOSE KILLED HAVE MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS. SOME OF THEM HAVE FOUGHT WITH EVERY OUNCE OF THEIR ENERGY TO HAVE THE INQUESTS INTO THE BOMBINGS REOPENED TO TRY AND ESTABLISH SOME OF THE DETAIL THAT HAS BEEN MISSING. TODAY, THE CORONER WILL BEGIN THAT PROCESS OF ATTEMPTING TO FILL SOME OF THE GAPS - BUT WILL IT BE ENOUGH? ALREADY THE SCOPE OF THE INQUESTS HAS BEEN NARROWED - AND THE CRUCIAL PERPETRATOR ISSUE WILL NOT BE ADDRESSED SO THE FAMILIES WILL NOT DISCOVER WHO WAS BEHIND THE KILLINGS.

IT WAS THE FIRST MAJOR CAMPAIGN FOUGHT ENTIRELY IN THE AIR. BBC REPORTER CLARK AINSWORTH AT BIGGIN HILL WHAT A SIGHT. WATCHING THOSE ICONIC WORLD WAR TWO AIRCRAFT TAKE TO THE SKIES ABOVE BIGGIN HILL WAS SOMETHING TO BEHOLD. SPECTATORS GASPED AS THEY THEN CIRCLED THE AIRFIELD IN FORMATION. THE ROAR OF THE MERLIN ENGINES AND THE GRACE WITH WHICH THE HURRICANE AND ESPECIALLY THE SPITFIRES, CLIMB, BANK, DIVE AND WEAVE THROUGH THE AIR IS A JOY TO BEHOLD.

THE NATIONAL AUDIT OFFICE CONCLUDED CHEATING HAD BEEN ""LARGE SCALE"", BUT INNOCENT PEOPLE MAY HAVE BEEN DEPORTED. THOUSANDS ACCUSED OF CHEATING HAD SINCE WON LEAVE TO REMAIN, IT ALSO SAID. THE HOME OFFICE SAID THE NAO'S REPORT HIGHLIGHTED ""THE SCALE AND ORGANISED NATURE OF THE ABUSE"", ADDING THAT 25 PEOPLE HAD RECEIVED CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS FOR THEIR ROLE IN THE SCANDAL. IN 2014, BBC PANORAMA BROADCAST FOOTAGE SHOWING ORGANISED CHEATING IN TWO ENGLISH LANGUAGE TEST CENTRES RUN BY THIRD PARTIES FOR THE NON-PROFIT ORGANISATION EDUCATIONAL TESTING SERVICE (ETS). THE SERVICE USED VOICE RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY TO TRY TO FIND OUT WHO HAD CHEATED BY HAVING SOMEONE ELSE SIT THEIR TEST. ETS CLASSIFIED 97% OF UK TESTS TAKEN BETWEEN 2011 AND 2014 AS SUSPICIOUS, 58% AS INVALID, AND 39% AS QUESTIONABLE. IN THE WAKE OF THE FINDINGS, THE HOME OFFICE SHUT DOWN COLLEGES, EXCLUDED STUDENTS AND CANCELLED VISAS.

""THIS DID NOT HAPPEN,"" HE ADDED. THE WATCHDOG SAID IT COULD NOT ESTIMATE ACCURATELY HOW MANY INNOCENT PEOPLE MAY HAVE BEEN WRONGLY IDENTIFIED AS CHEATS. AS OF MARCH, 11,000 PEOPLE WHO HAD TAKEN THE ENGLISH TESTS HAD LEFT THE COUNTRY AFTER AN ACCUSATION WAS MADE AGAINST THEM, THE NAO SAID. ONE STUDENT ACCUSED IN 2014, WHO DID NOT WANT TO USE HIS REAL NAME, TOLD THE BBC'S TODAY PROGRAMME THE HOME OFFICE TRIED TO DEPORT HIM IN 2017 AND KEPT HIM IN A DETENTION CENTRE FOR SEVEN DAYS. ""ALL THIS ACTUALLY MADE MY LIFE REALLY MISERABLE, I CANNOT EVEN FINISH MY STUDIES,"" HE SAID. AT THE BEGINNING OF MAY HE LAUNCHED AN APPEAL TO CLEAR HIS NAME. HE IS WAITING TO HEAR THE RESULT. LAST MONTH, A WOMAN WHO CAME TO THE UK FROM BANGLADESH IN 2010 TOLD THE VICTORIA DERBYSHIRE PROGRAMME SHE ALSO HAD AT ONE STAGE BEEN DETAINED AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF CHEATING. FATEMA CHOWDHURY, WHO FINISHED HER LAW DEGREE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF LONDON IN 2014, DENIED THE ALLEGATION AND SAID NO EVIDENCE OF HER ALLEGED CHEATING HAD BEEN PRESENTED TO HER. SHE IS NOT CURRENTLY BEING THREATENED WITH REMOVAL FROM THE UK, BUT WHILE REMAINING IN THE COUNTRY CANNOT WORK OR USE THE NHS FOR FREE.

THE ROCKET IS ENORMOUS MANY OBSERVERS HAVE BEEN STRUCK BY THE MISSILE'S VAST SIZE - THIS UNDATED PICTURE RELEASED BY STATE MEDIA OF MR KIM DWARFED BY THE ROCKET HE IS INSPECTING GIVES AN IDEA OF ITS SCALE. MICHAEL DUITSMAN, A RESEARCH ASSOCIATE AT THE CENTRE FOR NONPROLIFERATION STUDIES, NOTED THAT THE MISSILE WAS MUCH BIGGER THAN ITS PREVIOUS ITERATION THE HWASONG-14, AND ADDED: ""ONLY A FEW COUNTRIES CAN PRODUCE MISSILES OF THIS SIZE, AND NORTH KOREA JUST JOINED THE CLUB.""

THE ""NEW, MORE CAPABLE MISSILE"" SEEMS TO HAVE A MORE POWERFUL PROPULSION SYSTEM WITH TWO MAIN ENGINES AND LOOKS LIKE IT CAN CARRY MORE THAN TWICE AS MUCH PROPELLANT, DAVID WRIGHT OF THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS TOLD REUTERS NEWS AGENCY. IT ALSO HAS A LARGER AND BLUNTER NOSE CONE, WHICH COULD MEAN IT CAN CARRY A ""SUPER-LARGE HEAVY"" NUCLEAR WARHEAD ON ITS TIP, AS PYONGYANG CLAIMS. ALL THIS MEANS THAT THE MISSILE APPEARS CAPABLE OF TRANSPORTING A NUCLEAR WARHEAD FOR A LONG DISTANCE AND POSSIBLY SURVIVING ATMOSPHERIC RE-ENTRY. NORTH KOREA CLAIMS THAT THE HWASONG-15 IS A VIABLE INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILE (ICBM). THERE IS A NEW TRANSPORTER PHOTOS AND VIDEOS ALSO APPEARED TO SHOW THE MISSILE LAUNCHING FROM A PLATFORM, AND NOT FROM A MOBILE LAUNCHER WHICH NORTH KOREA HAS USED IN PREVIOUS MISSILE TESTS. A LARGE NINE-AXLE VEHICLE TRANSPORTED THE ROCKET TO THE SITE. ANALYSTS BELIEVE THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS DUE TO THE MISSILE'S LARGE SIZE, AND MEANS IT NEEDS MORE TIME TO LAUNCH. IN A SITUATION WHEN SNAP RESPONSES NEED TO BE MADE, ""THIS MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE DURING CRISES,"" SAID NK PRO ANALYST SCOTT LAFOY. THE LAUNCH TOOK PLACE AGAINST A STRIKING BACKDROP OF A NIGHT SKY FILLED WITH STARS, WITH A NOTICEABLE BUT PERHAPS UNSURPRISING ABSENCE OF LIGHT POLLUTION. IT WAS CELEBRATED WITH CIGARETTES A JUBILANT MR KIM IS SEEN IN MANY OF THE PICTURES, GRINNING AS THE ROCKET TAKES OFF. THE MISSILE'S STEEP TRAJECTORY CAN BE SEEN ON SCREENS IN THE BACKGROUND, APPARENTLY CHARTED IN REAL TIME. IT IS BELIEVED TO BE NORTH KOREA'S HIGHEST-EVER MISSILE, AND PYONGYANG SAID IT ACHIEVED A HEIGHT OF 4,475KM (2,780 MILES). MR KIM AND HIS COTERIE APPEARED TO WASTE NO TIME IN CELEBRATING THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH - WITH CIGARETTES. IT IS NOT KNOWN HOW FAR AWAY THE VIEWING PLATFORM WAS FROM THE LAUNCH SITE, BUT MR KIM MAY HAVE FORM IN SMOKING IN THE VICINITY OF FUEL-LADEN MISSILES - SOME BELIEVE THIS VIDEO FROM JULY SHOWS HIM PUFFING ON A CIGARETTE RIGHT NEXT TO A HWASONG-14."

EXPERTS HAVE PREDICTED IT IS ""HIGHLY LIKELY"" THE SPECIES - KNOWN AS THE HIGHLAND TIGER - WILL BECOME EXTINCT WITHOUT THE INTERVENTION. EU FUNDING WORTH £3.2M HAS BEEN SECURED TO DEVELOP A REINTRODUCTION CENTRE IN THE HIGHLAND WILDLIFE PARK AT KINCRAIG. THE CATS WILL BE RAISED AWAY FROM PUBLIC VIEW TO MINIMISE INTERACTION WITH HUMANS BEFORE THEIR RELEASE. POTENTIAL RELEASE SITES ARE BEING EXPLORED WITHIN THE CAIRNGORMS NATIONAL PARK. THE PROJECT IS BEING LED BY THE ROYAL ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF SCOTLAND WHICH RUNS THE WILDLIFE PARK. HELEN SENN, HEAD OF CONSERVATION, SAID: ""WILDCATS ARE ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION IN SCOTLAND BUT IT'S NOT TOO LATE. ""USING WILDCATS FROM THE EXISTING CAPTIVE POPULATION, AS WELL AS CATS FROM EUROPE TO BOOST THE GENE POOL, THE REINTRODUCTION CENTRE WILL PROVIDE A SUSTAINABLE SOURCE OF WILDCATS FOR YEARS TO COME."" THE SCOTTISH WILDCAT IS THE ONLY NATIVE MEMBER OF THE CAT FAMILY STILL FOUND IN THE WILD IN BRITAIN. 'FUNCTIONALLY EXTINCT' FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS, CONSERVATIONISTS HAVE BEEN FOCUSING ON FIVE ""PRIORITY AREAS"" IN SCOTLAND. THEIR MAIN DEFENCE HAS BEEN TO TRAP, NEUTER, VACCINATE AND RELEASE FERAL CATS IN THOSE REGIONS TO MINIMISE HARM TO THE WILDCAT POPULATIONS. BUT A STUDY BY THE INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR CONSERVATION OF NATURE DECLARED SCOTTISH WILDCATS TO BE ""FUNCTIONALLY EXTINCT"" BECAUSE OF HYBRIDISATION WITH FERAL OR DOMESTIC CATS. IT EXAMINED DNA FROM HUNDREDS OF DEAD AND LIVING WILDCATS AND FOUND THEY WERE PART OF THE SAME HYBRID GENE POOL AS DOMESTIC CATS. BUT WILDCATS HAVE BEEN BRED IN CAPTIVITY SINCE THE 1970S AND THEY NOW HAVE A STRONGER GENETIC LINK TO THEIR ANCESTORS. TO PREVENT FURTHER HYBRIDISATION, MARTIN GAYWOOD FROM SCOTTISH NATURAL HERITAGE BELIEVES IT IS IMPORTANT CAT OWNERS NEUTER AND VACCINATE THEIR PETS. HE ADDED: ""RELEASING SPECIES INTO THE WILD FOR CONSERVATION PURPOSES IS VERY COMPLEX AND CHALLENGING. ""WITH THE FIRST WILDCATS EXPECTED TO BE RELEASED INTO THE WILD IN 2022, NOW IS THE TIME FOR A PUBLIC DISCUSSION ON DOMESTIC AND FERAL CAT POPULATIONS, AND HOW WE MANAGE THESE, AND THE PUBLIC WILL HAVE AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN HELPING MINIMISE FUTURE HYBRIDISATION."" A BREEDING TEAM AT THE WILDLIFE PARK HAS MANAGED TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF WILDCATS IN CAPTIVITY IN THE UK TO 120 OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. FOUR ARE ON PUBLIC DISPLAY AT KINCRAIG WITH A FURTHER NINE LIVING IN LARGE ENCLOSURES OUT OF VIEW TO MINIMISE HUMAN INTERACTION. THE REST ARE HELD IN ZOOS AND PRIVATE COLLECTIONS ACROSS THE UK. THE PROJECT WILL USE EXISTING CATS TO BREED ANOTHER GENERATION WHICH WILL BE THE ONES SELECTED FOR RELEASE. EACH WILL BE FITTED WITH A GPS COLLAR WHICH ALLOWS THEIR MOVEMENTS TO BE MONITORED FOR ABOUT THE FIRST YEAR OF THEIR LIVES."

Get Me Out of Here.,"THE MID-BEDFORDSHIRE MP HAS HAD THE WHIP WITHDRAWN, A PARTY SOURCE SAID. MS DORRIES WILL BE THE FIRST SITTING MP TO APPEAR ON THE SHOW, WHICH COULD SEE HER BEING AWAY FROM HER JOB IN THE COMMONS FOR UP TO A MONTH. THE CHIEF WHIP WILL MEET HER WHEN SHE RETURNS FROM AUSTRALIA, WHEN SHE WILL BE EXPECTED TO EXPLAIN HERSELF. THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY IS CONCERNED ABOUT MS DORRIES' INABILITY TO DO PARLIAMENTARY AND CONSTITUENCY BUSINESS WHILE SHE IS TAKING PART IN THE PROGRAMME. MS DORRIES SAID SHE WANTED TO USE HER APPEARANCE ON THE REALITY SHOW TO RAISE AWARENESS OF ISSUES SHE IS INTERESTED IN, SUCH AS REDUCING THE TIME LIMIT ON ABORTIONS FROM 24 WEEKS TO 20 WEEKS. 'HEATED DEBATES' ""I'M DOING THE SHOW BECAUSE 16 MILLION PEOPLE WATCH IT. RATHER THAN MPS TALKING TO OTHER MPS ABOUT ISSUES IN PARLIAMENT, I THINK MPS SHOULD BE GOING TO WHERE PEOPLE GO,"" SHE TOLD THE DAILY MAIL. ""I'M NOT GOING IN THERE TO UPSET PEOPLE, BUT I HAVE OPINIONS. THERE ARE CERTAIN CAUSES THAT I'M INTERESTED IN, ONE OF WHICH IS '20 WEEKS'. ""I WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THIS ISSUE AROUND THE CAMPFIRE. I HOPE THERE WILL BE SOME LIVELY, HEATED DEBATES."" BUT SHE HAS COME IN FOR CRITICISM OVER HER DECISION TO ENTER THE CELEBRITY JUNGLE, WITH HOME SECRETARY THERESA MAY SAYING: ""FRANKLY, I THINK AN MP'S JOB IS IN THEIR CONSTITUENCY AND IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS."" CONSERVATIVE MP SARAH WOLLASTON SAID MS DORRIES SHOULD RESIGN, TELLING THE BBC: ""I WAS HORRIFIED, FRANKLY. I THINK IT JUST MAKES HER LOOK RIDICULOUS AND IT BRINGS POLITICS INTO DISREPUTE."" PAUL DUCKETT, CHAIRMAN OF THE MID-BEDFORSHIRE CONSERVATIVE ASSOCIATION, SAID MEMBERS MAY CONSIDER SACKING MS DORRIES OVER HER APPEARANCE ON THE SHOW, ADDING THAT HE HAD ONLY LEARNED ABOUT MS DORRIES APPEARANCE WHEN MEDIA ARRIVED IN THE CONSTITUENCY ON TUESDAY MORNING. MR DUCKETT SAID MS DORRIES WAS A HARD-WORKING MP BUT THE APPEARANCE MIGHT ""DETRACT FROM THE GRAVITAS"" OF HER ROLE. PRIME MINISTER DAVID CAMERON - WHO HAS PUBLICLY CLASHED WITH MS DORRIES IN THE PAST - EARLIER REFUSED TO BE DRAWN INTO THE ROW, SAYING: ""NADINE DORRIES CAN SPEAK FOR HERSELF ON THIS ISSUE.""

FORMER LIB DEM MP LEMBIT OPIK, WHO TOOK PART IN I'M A CELEBRITY IN 2010 AFTER LOSING HIS SEAT, TOLD THE BBC THE CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP WAS ""OUT OF TOUCH WITH THE ZEITGEIST OF THE NATION"". HE ADDED: ""I'M OUTRAGED BY THE FACT THAT IT THINKS SHE'S BEEN WRONG TO DO SOMETHING THAT CAN PUT POLITICS IN TOUCH WITH THE PUBLIC."" BUT FORMER TORY MP LOUISE MENSCH, WHO RECENTLY RESIGNED FROM THE COMMONS FOR FAMILY REASONS AND WHO HAS HAD A WELL-PUBLICISED SPAT WITH MS DORRIES OVER HER DECISION, TWEETED: ""NOTHING SADDER THAN A POLITICIAN, OR EX-POLITICIAN, ON ANY OF THOSE SHOWS."" LABOUR MP STEVE MCCABE SAID: ""DAVID CAMERON WAS TOO WEAK TO STOP NADINE DORRIES APPEARING ON A REALITY TV SHOW. ""BUT EVEN AFTER DITHERING OVER WHAT TO DO ALL DAY, BY SUSPENDING HER HE'S ACTED MORE QUICKLY OVER AN MP WHO CALLED HIM AN 'ARROGANT POSH BOY' THAN HE EVER DID OVER A CHIEF WHIP WHO SWORE AT A POLICE OFFICER."" IN FEBRUARY 2010, MS DORRIES TOOK PART IN THE CHANNEL 4 DOCUMENTARY SERIES TOWER BLOCK OF COMMONS, IN WHICH MPS MOVED IN WITH BENEFIT CLAIMANTS ON A DEPRIVED COUNCIL ESTATE. GEORGE GALLOWAY, THE ONLY OTHER SITTING MP TO HAVE TAKEN PART IN A REALITY GAME SHOW THAT TOOK HIM AWAY FROM THE COMMONS, WHEN HE SPENT THREE WEEKS ON CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER IN 2006, ALSO FACED CRITICISM THAT HE WAS NEGLECTING HIS CONSTITUENTS."

THE FAMILY OF SINCLAIR UPTON, WHO WAS BURIED THERE IN 1957, HAVE CONSENTED TO THEIR PLOT BEING EXCAVATED. FOR RELATIVES OF ALEXANDER GARTSHORE, THE SEARCH MAY CONFIRM WHETHER THE CHILD RAPIST COMMITTED ANOTHER HEINOUS CRIME. MOIRA'S TORTURED FAMILY HAVE NOT KNOWN WHAT HAPPENED TO HER SINCE SHE LEFT HER FAMILY HOME IN COATBRIDGE ON 23 FEBRUARY 1957. THE 11-YEAR-OLD, WHO WAS FIVE WEEKS SHORT OF HER 12TH BIRTHDAY, WAS RUNNING AN ERRAND FOR HER FAMILY TO A NEARBY CO-OP STORE WHEN SHE VANISHED DURING A BLIZZARD. SHE WAS LAST SEEN ON BOARD A BUS DRIVEN BY GARTSHORE, WHO WAS JAILED LATER THAT YEAR FOR RAPING A 17-YEAR-OLD BABYSITTER. DESPITE DECADES OF APPEALS, THE SCHOOLGIRL WAS NEVER TRACED. THE CASE REMAINED COLD UNTIL 1999, WHEN CHILD ABUSER JAMES GALLOGLEY NAMED HIS FORMER FRIEND GARTSHORE AS THE MURDERER. GALLOGLEY WAS SAID TO HAVE MADE THE CONFESSION TO ANOTHER INMATE WHILE HE WAS DYING IN PETERHEAD PRISON. FATHER ACCUSED AFTER GARTSHORE'S DEATH IN 2006, HIS DAUGHTER SANDRA BROWN, A FORMER FRIEND OF MOIRA, PUBLISHED A BOOK IN WHICH SHE ACCUSED HER LATE FATHER OF THE SCHOOLGIRL'S MURDER. SHE SAID SHE BELIEVED GARTSHORE HAD INITIALLY BURIED THE CHILD'S BODY IN A DITCH BUT LATER MOVED IT TO AN OPEN GRAVE AT OLD MONKLAND CEMETERY. MRS BROWN, WHO LATER RECEIVED AN OBE FOR SERVICES TO CHILD PROTECTION AND SET UP THE MOIRA ANDERSON FOUNDATION, BELIEVES HER FRIEND'S BODY LIES IN THE BURIAL PLOT OF SINCLAIR UPTON, A FORMER ACQUAINTANCE OF GARTSHORE. THE PAEDOPHILE IS LATER SAID TO HAVE REMARKED THAT MR SINCLAIR ""DONE HIM A FAVOUR"". IN 2007, A RADAR SCAN OF THE BURIAL PLOT FOUND ANOMALIES IN THE SOIL THAT WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH ANOTHER BODY BEING BURIED THERE. MRS BROWN AND MOIRA'S SISTER, JANET HART, WHO LIVES IN AUSTRALIA, THEN LAUNCHED A PETITION TO GET MR UPTON'S GRAVE EXHUMED. THE CASE FINALLY TOOK A DECISIVE TURN IN 2012 WHEN SCOTLAND'S TOP LAW OFFICER, LORD ADVOCATE FRANK MULHOLLAND, TOLD POLICE TO RE-OPEN IT AS A MURDER INQUIRY. IN DECEMBER LAST YEAR, A SHERIFF GRANTED A REQUEST FROM MOIRA'S RELATIVES TO OPEN THE GRAVE. WITH THE EXHUMATION NOW UNDER WAY, THE FAMILIES OF MR UPTON AND GARTSHORE - AND ABOVE ALL, THAT OF MOIRA ANDERSON - WILL BE HOPING FOR ANSWERS."

uk-44307037,"What is contempt of court, and why is Tommy Robinson guilty of it?","Former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson has been sentenced to nine months in prison after being found guilty of ""contempt of court"". What does that mean?","BY CLIVE COLEMANLEGAL CORRESPONDENT, BBC NEWS WHAT IS CONTEMPT OF COURT? CONTEMPT OF COURT LAWS EXIST TO ENSURE PEOPLE GET FAIR TRIALS. THE IDEA IS THAT JURIES MUST NOT BE INFLUENCED BY ANYTHING BUT THE EVIDENCE THEY HEAR IN COURT. THE RULES APPLY TO EVERYONE FROM JOURNALISTS TO PEOPLE POSTING COMMENTS ON SOCIAL MEDIA, AND EVEN JURORS. IF SOMEONE INTERFERES WITH A TRIAL, THE DEFENDANTS CAN WALK FREE AND A NEW TRIAL MIGHT HAVE TO BE HELD. THE MAXIMUM SENTENCE FOR CONTEMPT OF COURT IS TWO YEARS IN PRISON, BUT IT CAN ALSO BE PUNISHED WITH AN UNLIMITED FINE. THE LAW IS SET OUT IN THE 1981 CONTEMPT OF COURT ACT. CONTEMPT INCLUDES PUBLISHING ANYTHING THAT CREATES A SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF SERIOUSLY PREJUDICING ""ACTIVE"" CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS. PROCEEDINGS BECOME ""ACTIVE"" WHEN A SUSPECT IS ARRESTED. SOMEONE COULD ALSO BE IN CONTEMPT BY ACTIONS INCLUDING TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS OR FILM, RECORDING WHAT IS SAID IN COURT OR TALKING TO A JURY MEMBER ABOUT A CASE. WHY WAS TOMMY ROBINSON FOUND GUILTY OF CONTEMPT? TOMMY ROBINSON, ALSO KNOWN AS STEPHEN YAXLEY-LENNON, COMMITTED CONTEMPT OF COURT BY BROADCASTING FOOTAGE OF DEFENDANTS ACCUSED OF SEXUAL EXPLOITATION. THE HOUR-LONG BROADCAST, OUTSIDE LEEDS CROWN COURT IN MAY 2018, WAS SEEN BY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. LAWYERS FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAID REPORTING RESTRICTIONS HAD BEEN PUT IN PLACE. THESE POSTPONED THE PUBLICATION OF ANY DETAILS OF THE CASE UNTIL THE END OF A SERIES OF LINKED TRIALS, INVOLVING 29 DEFENDANTS. THIS WAS TO STOP THE JURIES IN THOSE CASES BEING INFLUENCED. THEY ALSO SAID THE MANNER IN WHICH ROBINSON FILMED THE DEFENDANTS AT COURT WAS A PROBLEM. THE AGGRESSIVE CONFRONTATION COULD HAVE INFLUENCED THOSE ON BAIL NOT TO CO-OPERATE WITH THE TRIAL. JUDGE DAME VICTORIA SHARP SAID WHEN EXPLAINING THE DECISION, THAT MR ROBINSON ENCOURAGED ""VIGILANTE ACTION"" IN HIS FACEBOOK LIVE. SHE ALSO SAID THAT THE VIDEO COULD HAVE ""SERIOUSLY IMPEDED"" JUSTICE OVER A SEXUAL GROOMING GANG'S TRIAL. ROBINSON WAS ORIGINALLY JAILED FOR 13 MONTHS FOR THE OFFENCE IN MAY 2018. BUT THE COURT OF APPEAL SAID HIS CASE HADN'T BEEN HANDLED FAIRLY. THEN, THE ATTORNEY GENERAL GEOFFREY COX - THE GOVERNMENT'S TOP LEGAL ADVISER - ANNOUNCED THAT NEW PROCEEDINGS COULD BE BROUGHT AGAINST HIM. WHAT OTHER FAMOUS CASES HAVE THERE BEEN? IN 2011, THE SUN AND THE DAILY MAIL WERE FOUND GUILTY OF CONTEMPT FOR PICTURES THEY PUBLISHED DURING A MURDER TRIAL. THEY HAD SHOWN THE DEFENDANT HOLDING A GUN, WHICH RISKED PREJUDICING THE JURY. THE FOLLOWING YEAR, THE DAILY MAIL AND THE DAILY MIRROR WERE FOUND GUILTY OF CONTEMPT, FOLLOWING SERIAL KILLER LEVI BELLFIELD'S CONVICTION FOR THE MURDER OF SCHOOLGIRL MILLY DOWLER. THEIR ARTICLES WERE PART OF AN ""AVALANCHE"" OF BAD CHARACTER INFORMATION ABOUT BELLFIELD, THE HEARING WAS TOLD. THE DAILY MIRROR ARTICLE DETAILED HIS VIOLENT TREATMENT AND SEXUAL ABUSE OF FORMER PARTNERS, INCLUDING JO COLLINGS. HOWEVER, THE JURY STILL HAD TO CONSIDER ITS VERDICT ON AN ATTEMPTED ABDUCTION CHARGE RELATING TO ANOTHER VICTIM. THE COVERAGE WAS CONSIDERED PREJUDICIAL AND THE JURY HAD TO BE DISCHARGED, DENYING THE VICTIM AND HER FAMILY THE CHANCE OF JUSTICE. BELLFIELD WAS ALREADY IN JAIL FOR THE MURDERS OF AMELIE DELAGRANGE AND MARSHA MCDONNELL AND THE ATTEMPTED MURDER OF KATE SHEEDY. DOES IT APPLY ON SOCIAL MEDIA? YES, DISCUSSIONS ABOUT COURT CASES STILL NEED TO STAY INSIDE THE JURY ROOM. IN 2011, IN THE FIRST CASE OF ITS KIND, JUROR JOANNE FRAILL WAS PUNISHED FOR CONTACTING DEFENDANT JAMIE SEWART VIA FACEBOOK - CAUSING A £6M DRUGS TRIAL TO COLLAPSE. FRAILL WAS JAILED FOR EIGHT MONTHS FOR CONTEMPT FOR BOTH CONTACTING SEWART AND SEARCHING ONLINE ABOUT THE CASE. SEWART HAD ALREADY BEEN CLEARED BUT OTHER DEFENDANTS WERE STILL ON TRIAL, SO PROCEEDINGS WERE COMPROMISED. SOCIAL MEDIA USERS HAVE BEEN WARNED ABOUT COMMENTING ON COURT PROCEEDINGS, AND BREACHING RESTRICTIONS PUT IN PLACE. ACTRESS TINA MALONE, FOR EXAMPLE, WAS GIVEN A SUSPENDED PRISON SENTENCE FOR BREACHING AN INJUNCTION PROTECTING THE IDENTITY OF JON VENABLES - ONE OF JAMES BULGER'S KILLERS. SHE SHARED A FACEBOOK MESSAGE WHICH WAS SAID TO INCLUDE AN IMAGE AND VENABLES' NEW NAME. WHAT ELSE COUNTS AS CONTEMPT OF COURT? INTIMIDATION: JURIES MUST BE ABLE TO GIVE VERDICTS WITHOUT BEING SUBJECT TO ABUSE OR INTIMIDATION. CARRYING OUT RESEARCH: IN 2012, JUROR AND UNIVERSITY LECTURER THEODORA DALLAS WAS JAILED FOR SIX MONTHS FOR CARRYING OUT HER OWN RESEARCH ABOUT DEFENDANT BARRY MEDLOCK, WHO WAS ON TRIAL FOR CAUSING GRIEVOUS BODILY HARM. TAKING OR POSTING PHOTOS: IN 2016, DAMIAN PARKER-STOKES WAS JAILED FOR 15 MONTHS FOR TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS IN COURT AS HIS FRIEND RYAN SHEPPARD WAS BEING JAILED FOR MURDER. PARKER-STOKES POSTED ONE IMAGE ON SHEPPARD'S FACEBOOK PAGE WITH THE WORDS: ""RESPECT G AT LEAST U HAD THE BALLS TO ADMIT IT ..."" THE THEN LORD CHIEF JUSTICE LORD THOMAS, SAID PEOPLE WHO USED FACEBOOK TO ""MOCK THE ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE"" AND ""CAUSE CONSIDERABLE CONCERN"" TO A VICTIM'S FAMILY, ""MUST BE DETERRED BY THE MOST SEVERE SENTENCES""."

uk-26492684,TV licence fee non-payment 'could be decriminalised',"Not paying the TV licence fee could become a civil offence, rather than a criminal one, under plans being considered by ministers.","CULTURE SECRETARY MARIA MILLER SAID ""DECRIMINALISATION OF THE LICENCE FEE SHOULD BE ON THE TABLE"" DURING THE BBC'S CHARTER REVIEW BEFORE 2017. THE BBC SAID CHANGING THE LAW COULD LEAD TO MORE PEOPLE FAILING TO PAY. IN 2012 ABOUT 155,000 WERE CONVICTED AND FINED FOR NOT PAYING THE £145.50 FEE. IN TOTAL 180,000 PEOPLE WERE PROSECUTED FOR NOT PAYING THEIR LICENCE - WHICH IS NEEDED TO WATCH OR RECORD LIVE BROADCASTS ON ANY DEVICE - ACCOUNTING FOR MORE THAN ONE IN 10 CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS THAT YEAR. IN OCTOBER 2013 HUFFINGTON POST REPORTED THAT IN RESPONSE TO A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION REQUEST THE MINISTRY OF JUSTICE HAD REVEALED THAT 107 PEOPLE WERE JAILED BETWEEN JANUARY 2011 AND MARCH 2013 FOR FAILING TO PAY FINES RELATED TO NOT HAVING A TV LICENCE. JUSTICE SECRETARY CHRIS GRAYLING HAS NOW TOLD THE DAILY TELEGRAPH ""SERIOUS WORK"" WOULD BE DONE ON THE PROPOSAL TO MAKE NON-PAYMENT A CIVIL OFFENCE AND THAT IT COULD EASE THE PRESSURE ON CRIMINAL COURTS. HE SAID: ""THE CULTURE SECRETARY AND I BOTH AGREE THAT THIS IS A REALLY INTERESTING IDEA - PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE PRESSURE ON OUR COURTS SYSTEM. ""OUR DEPARTMENTS WILL BE DOING SOME SERIOUS WORK ON THE PROPOSAL."" MS MILLER SAID: ""THIS IS AN INTERESTING IDEA BUT TIMING IS CRUCIAL AND DECRIMINALISATION OF THE LICENCE FEE SHOULD BE ON THE TABLE DURING CHARTER REVIEW, NOT SEPARATE TO THE PROCESS.'' THE BBC'S CURRENT ROYAL CHARTER, WHICH EXPIRES IN 2016, SETS OUT HOW IT SHOULD BE FUNDED, WHAT IT DOES AND HOW IT IS MANAGED. A SPOKESMAN FOR THE CULTURE SECRETARY ADDED: ""MARIA WILL PUT DECRIMINALISATION OF THE LICENCE FEE ON THE TABLE DURING CHARTER REVIEW DISCUSSIONS, BUT TO DO IT BEFORE MAKES NO SENSE. ""SHE HAS MADE CLEAR THAT THE BBC NEEDS TO GET ITS HOUSE IN ORDER, PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO GOVERNANCE AND TRANSPARENCY, HAVING DECRIMINALISATION ON THE TABLE DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS WILL FOCUS THE BBC'S MINDS."" BUT CONSERVATIVE MP ANDREW BRIDGEN IS SEEKING TO INTRODUCE THE CHANGE THROUGH AN AMENDMENT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S DEREGULATION BILL. IT WOULD MAKE NON-PAYMENT OF THE LICENCE FEE A CIVIL MATTER, WITH A FINE FOR OFFENDERS SET BY THE GOVERNMENT. HE TOLD THE DAILY TELEGRAPH: ""IT IS OUTRAGEOUS THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE BROUGHT IN TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THROUGH THIS MEANS. ""I BELIEVE THAT NON-PAYMENT SHOULD BE TREATED IN THE WAY THAT PARKING TICKETS ARE. ""IT IS ABSURD THAT THE COURTS ARE BEING CLOGGED UP BY SUCH A MINOR OFFENCE."" THE NEWSPAPER REPORTED THAT THE AMENDMENT HAD BEEN BACKED BY 101 CROSS-PARTY MPS. A BBC SPOKESMAN SAID: ""LEGISLATION IS A MATTER FOR THE GOVERNMENT, HOWEVER CHANGING THE LAW COULD LEAD TO HIGHER EVASION. ""JUST A 1% INCREASE IN EVASION WOULD LEAD TO THE LOSS OF AROUND £35M, THE EQUIVALENT OF AROUND 10 BBC LOCAL RADIO STATIONS."""

world-42873633,Reality Check: Where are the world's nuclear weapons?,"The Pentagon has outlined how it wants to revamp the US nuclear arsenal, and develop new low-yield bombs, largely in response to the threat from Russia.","BY REALITY CHECK TEAMBBC NEWS REALITY CHECK LOOKS INTO WHERE THE WORLD'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS ARE LOCATED AND WHO OWNS THEM. WHILE THE GLOBAL STOCKPILE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS HAS SHRUNK SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE COLD WAR, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF WARHEADS THAT COULD BE LAUNCHED AT SHORT NOTICE, AND EXPERTS SAY EVERY NUCLEAR-ARMED NATION IS MODERNISING ITS ARSENAL OR HAS PLANS TO DO SO. COUNTRIES KEEP MOST DETAILS OF THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS SECRET, BUT IT IS KNOWN THAT NINE COUNTRIES OWN THE ESTIMATED MORE THAN 9,000 NUCLEAR WEAPONS THAT ARE IN MILITARY SERVICE. THESE ARE EITHER DEPLOYED - MOUNTED ON LAND OR SEA MISSILES AND KEPT AT AIR BASES - OR IN STORAGE. ABOUT 1800 ARE ON HIGH ALERT AND COULD BE FIRED WITH LITTLE WARNING. THE US AND RUSSIA OWN THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE WORLD'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS. INCLUDING RETIRED WARHEADS WAITING TO BE DISMANTLED, THE TOTAL IS SAID TO BE ALMOST 15,000, ACCORDING TO THE STOCKHOLM INTERNATIONAL PEACE RESEARCH INSTITUTE (SIPRI). THIS IS A MARKED DECLINE SINCE THE 1980S WHEN THE FIGURE PEAKED AT AROUND 70,000. WHY ONLY THESE COUNTRIES? SINCE 1970, 190 COUNTRIES INCLUDING THE US, RUSSIA, UK, FRANCE AND CHINA HAVE JOINED THE NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY (NPT). INDIA, ISRAEL AND PAKISTAN NEVER SIGNED THE AGREEMENT AND NORTH KOREA LEFT IN 2003. THE NPT RECOGNISES FIVE STATES HAVING NUCLEAR WEAPONS - US, RUSSIA, FRANCE, UK AND CHINA - ALL OF WHICH HAD TESTED NUCLEAR WEAPONS BEFORE THE AGREEMENT CAME INTO EFFECT. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, THESE COUNTRIES SHOULD NOT MAINTAIN AN ARSENAL FOREVER. THE TREATY PROHIBITS NON-RECOGNISED STATES FROM DEVELOPING NUCLEAR WEAPONS. SOUTH AFRICA, AND FORMER SOVIET UNION COUNTRIES BELARUS, KAZAKHSTAN AND UKRAINE HAVE ALL GIVEN UP THEIRS. ARE COUNTRIES MAKING PROGRESS ON DISARMAMENT? THE US, UK AND RUSSIA HAVE ALL BEEN REDUCING THE SIZE OF THEIR WARHEAD INVENTORIES, ISRAEL'S AND FRANCE'S ARE SAID TO BE RELATIVELY UNCHANGED AND CHINA, PAKISTAN, INDIA AND NORTH KOREA ARE BELIEVED TO PRODUCING MORE, ACCORDING TO THE FEDERATION OF AMERICAN SCIENTISTS. BUT AT THE VERY LEAST, EXPERTS SAY, EVERY NUCLEAR-ARMED STATE HAS PLANS IN PLACE TO MODERNISE ITS NUCLEAR STOCKPILE. MODERNISATION IS CONTRARY TO THE SPIRIT OF THE NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY, SAYS SHANNON KILE, HEAD OF SIPRI'S NUCLEAR PROJECT. THE UK IS PLANNING TO REPLACE ITS FLEET OF VANGUARD NUCLEAR ARMED SUBMARINES, WHICH CARRIES ITS TRIDENT NUCLEAR MISSILES. THE OVERALL SIZE OF ITS ARSENAL WILL BE REDUCED TO NO MORE THAN 180 BY THE MID-2020S. THE US MAY SPEND MORE THAN $1 TRILLION (£703BN) BY THE 2040S UPGRADING ITS NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES. SOME OF AMERICA'S WARHEADS CAN BE FOUND AROUND EUROPE IN BELGIUM, GERMANY, ITALY, NETHERLANDS, AND TURKEY, WHICH HOST AROUND 150 WARHEADS BETWEEN THEM. NORTH KOREA CONDUCTED ITS SIXTH NUCLEAR TEST IN SEPTEMBER AND THE JURY IS STILL OUT ON WHETHER KIM JONG-UN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAMME IS CAPABLE OF ATTACHING A WARHEAD TO A LONG-RANGE MISSILE. IN RECENT MONTHS, NORTH KOREA HAS DEMONSTRATED IT HAS INCREASINGLY ADVANCED MISSILES, WHICH ARE SAID TO HAVE BROUGHT THE UNITED STATES WITHIN RANGE. WILL THERE EVER BE A NUCLEAR-FREE WORLD? A FEW MONTHS INTO HIS PRESIDENCY, BARACK OBAMA TOLD A CROWD OF THOUSANDS IN PRAGUE THAT UNDER HIS WATCH, AMERICA WOULD COMMIT ""TO SEEK THE PEACE AND SECURITY OF A WORLD WITHOUT NUCLEAR WEAPONS"". IT APPEARED AS THOUGH THE WORLD EDGED CLOSER IN JULY 2017 WHEN MORE THAN 100 COUNTRIES ENDORSED A UN TREATY TO BAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS ALTOGETHER. SO FAR DOZENS OF COUNTRIES HAVE SIGNED THE LEGALLY BINDING INSTRUMENT, THE FIRST AGREEMENT OF ITS KIND TO EXPLICITLY BAN NUCLEAR WEAPONS. HOWEVER THE NUCLEAR-ARMED STATES BOYCOTTED THE NEGOTIATIONS. THE UK AND US SAY THEY NEVER INTEND TO JOIN THE TREATY BECAUSE IT UNDERMINES THE NPT. ALLIED NATO COUNTRIES ALSO FAILED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE NEW AGREEMENT. THE INTERNATIONAL CAMPAIGN TO ABOLISH NUCLEAR WEAPONS (ICAN), THE ORGANISATION BEHIND THE TREATY, WAS AWARDED THE 2017 NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. WHAT DO YOU WANT BBC REALITY CHECK TO INVESTIGATE?

health-46865204,"A bit of meat, a lot of veg - the flexitarian diet to feed 10bn","A diet has been developed that promises to save lives, feed 10 billion people and all without causing catastrophic damage to the planet.","BY JAMES GALLAGHERHEALTH AND SCIENCE CORRESPONDENT, BBC NEWS SCIENTISTS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO FEED BILLIONS MORE PEOPLE IN THE DECADES TO COME. THEIR ANSWER - ""THE PLANETARY HEALTH DIET"" - DOES NOT COMPLETELY BANISH MEAT AND DAIRY. BUT IT IS RECOMMENDING WE GET MOST OF OUR PROTEIN FROM NUTS AND LEGUMES (SUCH AS BEANS AND LENTILS) INSTEAD. THEIR DIET NEEDS AN ENORMOUS SHIFT IN WHAT WE PILE ON TO OUR PLATES AND FOR US TO TURN TO FOODS THAT WE BARELY EAT. WHAT CHANGES AM I GOING TO HAVE TO MAKE? IF YOU EAT MEAT EVERY DAY THEN THIS IS THE FIRST BIGGIE. FOR RED MEAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT A BURGER A WEEK OR A LARGE STEAK A MONTH AND THAT'S YOUR LOT. YOU CAN STILL HAVE A COUPLE OF PORTIONS OF FISH AND THE SAME OF CHICKEN A WEEK, BUT PLANTS ARE WHERE THE REST OF YOUR PROTEIN WILL NEED TO COME FROM. THE RESEARCHERS ARE RECOMMENDING NUTS AND A GOOD HELPING OF LEGUMES EVERY DAY INSTEAD. THERE'S ALSO A MAJOR PUSH ON ALL FRUIT AND VEG, WHICH SHOULD MAKE UP HALF OF EVERY PLATE OF FOOD WE EAT. ALTHOUGH THERE'S A CULL ON ""STARCHY VEGETABLES"" SUCH AS THE HUMBLE POTATO OR CASSAVA WHICH IS WIDELY EATEN IN AFRICA. SO WHAT IS THE DIET IN DETAIL? IF YOU SERVED IT ALL UP THIS IS WHAT YOU WOULD BE ALLOWED EACH DAY: THE DIET HAS ROOM FOR 31G OF SUGAR AND ABOUT 50G WORTH OF OILS LIKE OLIVE OIL. HOW DO YOUR FOOD CHOICES IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT? DON'T CRY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PLAY WITH OUR INTERACTIVE. UPDATE YOUR BROWSER TO HAVE A GO! HOW DO YOUR FOOD CHOICES IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT? YOUR RESULTS ARE BELOW WILL IT TASTE AWFUL? PROF WALTER WILLET, ONE OF THE RESEARCHERS WHO IS BASED AT HARVARD, SAID NO AND THAT AFTER A CHILDHOOD ON A FARM EATING THREE PORTIONS OF RED MEAT A DAY HE WAS NOW PRETTY MUCH IN LINE WITH THE PLANETARY HEALTH DIET. ""THERE'S TREMENDOUS VARIETY THERE,"" HE SAID. ""YOU CAN TAKE THOSE FOODS AND PUT THEM TOGETHER IN THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT WAYS. WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT A DEPRIVATION DIET HERE, IT IS HEALTHY EATING THAT IS FLEXIBLE AND ENJOYABLE."" IS THIS FOR REAL, OR JUST A FANTASY? THIS PLAN REQUIRES CHANGES TO DIETS IN PRETTY MUCH EVERY CORNER OF THE WORLD. EUROPE AND NORTH AMERICA NEED TO CUT BACK MASSIVELY ON RED MEAT, EAST ASIA NEEDS TO CUT BACK ON FISH, AFRICA ON STARCHY VEGETABLES. ""HUMANITY HAS NEVER ATTEMPTED TO CHANGE THE FOOD SYSTEM AT THIS SCALE AND THIS SPEED,"" SAID LINE GORDON, DIRECTOR OF THE STOCKHOLM RESILIENCE CENTRE, AT STOCKHOLM UNIVERSITY. ""WHETHER IT'S A FANTASY OR NOT, A FANTASY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE BAD... IT'S TIME TO DREAM OF A GOOD WORLD,"" SHE SAYS. TAXES ON RED MEAT ARE ONE OF THE MANY OPTIONS THE RESEARCHERS SAY MAY BE NECESSARY TO PERSUADE US TO SWITCH DIETS. WHO CAME UP WITH THIS? A GROUP OF 37 SCIENTISTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD WERE BROUGHT TOGETHER AS PART OF THE EAT-LANCET COMMISSION. THEY'RE A MIX OF EXPERTS FROM FARMING TO CLIMATE CHANGE TO NUTRITION. THEY TOOK TWO YEARS TO COME UP WITH THEIR FINDINGS WHICH HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE LANCET. WHY DO WE NEED A DIET FOR 10 BILLION PEOPLE? THE WORLD POPULATION REACHED SEVEN BILLION IN 2011 AND IT'S NOW AROUND 7.7 BILLION. THAT FIGURE IS EXPECTED TO REACH 10 BILLION AROUND 2050 AND WILL KEEP ON CLIMBING. WILL IT SAVE LIVES? THE RESEARCHERS SAY THE DIET WILL PREVENT ABOUT 11 MILLION PEOPLE DYING EACH YEAR. THAT NUMBER IS LARGELY DOWN TO CUTTING DISEASES RELATED TO UNHEALTHY DIETS SUCH AS HEART ATTACKS, STROKES AND SOME CANCERS. THESE ARE NOW THE BIGGEST KILLERS IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. HOW BAD IS FARMING FOR THE PLANET? THE USE OF LAND FOR GROWING FOOD AND FORESTRY ACCOUNTS FOR AROUND A QUARTER OF GLOBAL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THAT'S ABOUT THE SAME AS FROM ELECTRICITY AND HEATING, AND SUBSTANTIALLY MORE THAN FROM ALL THE TRAINS, PLANES AND AUTOMOBILES ON THE PLANET. WHEN YOU LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT THE FOOD SECTOR'S ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, YOU CAN SEE THAT MEAT AND DAIRY ARE THE MAJOR FACTORS. WORLDWIDE, LIVESTOCK ACCOUNTS FOR BETWEEN 14.5 AND 18% OF HUMAN-INDUCED GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WHEN IT COMES TO OTHER WARMING GASES, AGRICULTURE IS ONE OF THE LEADING CONTRIBUTORS TO BOTH METHANE AND NITROUS OXIDE EMISSIONS. AGRICULTURE IS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF AIR POLLUTION WITH AMMONIA FROM FARMS A MAJOR CAUSE OF FINE PARTICULATE MATTER, WHICH THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) SAYS IS A THREAT TO HEALTH WORLDWIDE. SIMILARLY WHEN IT COMES TO WATER, AGRICULTURE AND FOOD PRODUCTIONS ARE ONE OF THE BIGGEST THREATS, CONSUMING 70% OF GLOBAL FRESHWATER SOURCES FOR IRRIGATION. SO WILL THIS DIET SAVE THE PLANET? THE RESEARCHERS' AIM WAS TO FEED MORE PEOPLE WHILE: HOWEVER, JUST CHANGING DIETS IS NOWHERE NEAR ENOUGH. TO MAKE THE NUMBERS ADD UP, ALSO REQUIRES A HALVING OF FOOD WASTE AND AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF FOOD PRODUCED ON CURRENT FARMLAND. WHY ISN'T MEAT BEING BANNED? ""IF WE WERE JUST MINIMISING GREENHOUSE GASES WE'D SAY EVERYONE BE VEGAN,"" SAID PROF WILLET. HOWEVER, IT WAS UNCLEAR WHETHER A VEGAN DIET WAS THE HEALTHIEST OPTION, HE SAID. SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW? THE EAT-LANCET COMMISSION IS GOING TO TAKE ITS FINDINGS TO GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD AND BODIES SUCH AS THE WHO TO SEE IF IT CAN BEGIN TO CHANGE THE WAY WE EAT. FOLLOW JAMES ON TWITTER"
uk-northern-ireland-41401080,Belfast-built Tucano touches down for RAF squadron tour,There was a warm welcome home for a pair of Tucano Mark I planes as they roared in over Aldergrove airbase in County Antrim.,"BY MERVYN JESSBBC NEWS NI THE BELFAST-BUILT AIRCRAFT MADE THE JOURNEY TO MARK THE CENTENARY OF THE ROYAL AIR FORCE'S (RAF) 72 SQUADRON. THEIR VISIT ALSO COINCIDES WITH THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BASIC TRAINER'S FIRST ROLL-OUT AT THE SHORTS FACTORY. THE STOP IS THE LAST ONE ON A CENTENARY TOUR OF AIRBASES THAT HAVE BEEN HOME TO 72 SQUADRON OVER THE DECADES. FLIGHT LIEUTENANT CHRIS NASH, WHO FLEW ONE OF THE TUCANOS INTO BELFAST, EXPLAINED WHY IT IS PAINTED IN THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN COLOURS OF THE SPITFIRE, WITH ENNISKILLEN WRITTEN ON THE FUSELAGE. ""IT'S TO DO WITH THE WAY THE SPITFIRES WERE FINANCED FOR 72 SQUADRON DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR,"" HE SAID. ""A WAR FUND WAS SET UP AT THAT TIME AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES RAISED MONEY TO HELP BUILD A SPITFIRE, AND THAT'S WHY THEY GOT THEIR NAME DOWN THE SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT."" THE EXPERIENCED JET PILOT EXPLAINED THAT HE FELT A SENSE OF INTIMIDATION AS A YOUNG PILOT FLYING THE TUCANO, THE RAF'S BASIC TRAINING PLANE, FOR THE FIRST TIME. ""THERE'S MORE POWER,"" HE SAID. ""YOU SIT IN THE FRONT AS A STUDENT WITH THE STAFF OFFICER BEHIND YOU, WHEREAS IN PREVIOUS AIRCRAFT IT'S SIDE BY SIDE. ""YOU'RE WEARING AN OXYGEN MASK, YOU'RE ON AN EJECTION SEAT AND IT ALL STARTS TO FEEL FAR MORE MILITARY. ""IT'S QUITE CHALLENGING TO FLY BUT VERY REWARDING ONCE YOU GET USED TO IT AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE RAF'S BASIC TRAINER UNTIL 2019."" WHEN THE TUCANO WAS FIRST ROLLED OUT AT SHORTS IN EAST BELFAST TO GREAT FANFARE IN 1987, THE FUTURE OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS DEPENDED ON IT. BUT THE LAUNCH DAY WAS NOT WITHOUT CONTROVERSY. SEVERAL HUNDRED SHORTS WORKERS BLOCKED A ROAD OUTSIDE THE FACTORY IN PROTEST AT THE PRESENCE OF THE THEN NORTHERN IRELAND SECRETARY TOM KING OVER THE GOVERNMENT'S SIGNING OF THE ANGLO-IRISH AGREEMENT. SIR PHILIP FOREMAN, THE SHORTS BOSS AT THE THE TIME, WAS NOT IMPRESSED BY THOSE WHO TOOK PART IN THE PROTEST, DESCRIBING THEIR ACTIONS AS DAMAGING. ""I'M SURE WHAT WENT ON TODAY WILL BE SEEN AROUND THE WORLD AND IT WILL CERTAINLY DAMAGE OUR BUSINESS - IT PUTS AT RISK 7,000 JOBS,"" HE SAID. ""BUT I DON'T THINK THE PEOPLE WHO DID THIS SORT OF THING REALLY UNDERSTAND THE DAMAGE THEY ARE DOING AND I CAN'T STRESS TOO STRONGLY HOW IRRESPONSIBLE IT IS."" IN SPITE OF THE CONCERNS, THE TUCANO PROVED TO BE A SUCCESS. THE RAF ORDERED MORE THAN 100 OF THE AIRCRAFT, WHICH WERE BUILT IN A JOINT VENTURE WITH THE BRAZILIAN AEROSPACE COMPANY EMBRAER. FORMER SHORTS TEST PILOT PADDY CROWTHER HAS HIS OWN MEMORIES OF THAT TIME, PARTICULARLY OF ONE OCCASION WHEN HIS ENGINE CUT OUT WHILE FLYING OVER RATHLIN ISLAND. ""THERE IS ONLY ONE ENGINE ON THE TUCANO SO IT MADE FOR AN INTERESTING TIME - WE HAD TO DIVERT TO MACHRIHANISH NEAR THE MULL OF KINTYRE,"" HE EXPLAINED. ""BUT APART FROM THAT IT WAS VERY ENJOYABLE TO FLY - EVEN PEOPLE LIKE PRINCE WILLIAM THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD. ""I SPOKE TO HIS FATHER PRINCE CHARLES ABOUT IT AT HILLSBOROUGH CASTLE ONCE AND THEY BOTH THOUGHT THE TUCANO WAS EXCELLENT. ""COMPARED TO OTHER MORE SEDATE SHORTS AIRCRAFT LIKE THE SKYVAN, 330 AND 360 PASSENGER AEROPLANES, THE TUCANO HAD A LITTLE MORE OOMPH TO IT."" SHORTS HAS A HISTORY OF SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPING AND BUILDING AIRCRAFT, BOTH CIVIL AND MILITARY. INCLUDING THE WORLD WAR TWO STIRLING BOMBER. THE TUCANO IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH THE BEST OF THEM."

THE GOVERNMENT WAS FORCED TO ACT BY A HIGH COURT JUDGE AFTER LOSING A LEGAL BATTLE WITH LAWYERS CLIENTEARTH. IT CAME AFTER THE UK GOT A ""FINAL WARNING"" ON AIR QUALITY FROM THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION. ONE ROAD IN BRIXTON, SOUTH LONDON, HIT ITS PERMITTED ANNUAL POLLUTION LEVEL IN FIVE DAYS.

FORMER LABOUR CHANCELLOR GORDON BROWN INTRODUCED A LOWER VEHICLE TAX FOR DIESEL CARS IN 2001 - BUT THERE HAS BEEN INCREASING CONCERN THAT THEY EMIT DANGEROUS LEVELS OF NITROGEN DIOXIDE, WHICH IS THOUGHT TO CAUSE THOUSANDS OF PREMATURE DEATHS IN THE UK. LONDON MAYOR SADIQ KHAN ANNOUNCED ON TUESDAY THAT FROM APRIL 2019 THERE WOULD BE A £12.50 CHARGE - ON TOP OF THE EXISTING CONGESTION CHARGE - IN CENTRAL LONDON FOR PETROL CARS THAT DO NOT MEET EURO 4 STANDARDS AND DIESEL VEHICLES THAT DO NOT MEET EURO 6 STANDARDS. ACCORDING TO CITY HALL, THIS WILL HIT MOST PETROL CARS MORE THAN 13 YEARS OLD IN 2019, AND DIESEL CARS MORE THAN FOUR YEARS OLD IN 2019.

MOTORING ORGANISATIONS HAVE SAID DIESEL CAR DRIVERS ARE BEING ""PUNISHED"" FOR FOLLOWING A PREVIOUS GOVERNMENT'S POLICY. AND MRS MAY HAS NOW HINTED THERE WILL BE SCHEMES TO HELP DRIVERS WHO WERE TOLD THAT DIESEL VEHICLES WERE THE RIGHT PURCHASE. SPEAKING ON HER TRIP TO JORDAN AND SAUDI ARABIA, SHE SAID: ""DECISIONS WILL BE TAKEN WHEN WE PRODUCE THAT [AIR QUALITY] PLAN. ""BUT I'M VERY CONSCIOUS OF THE FACT THAT PAST GOVERNMENTS HAVE ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO BUY DIESEL CARS AND WE NEED TO TAKE THAT INTO ACCOUNT WHEN WE LOOK AT WHAT WE DO IN THE FUTURE."" SHE DID NOT SET OUT ANY SPECIFIC PLANS, BUT THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS OF A SCRAPPAGE SCHEME THAT COULD PAY PEOPLE TO GET RID OF THEIR DIESEL VEHICLES."

BY BBC BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT JOE LYNAM ACCORDING TO PHILIP HAMMOND, BRITAIN MIGHT BE ""FORCED"" TO CHANGE ITS ECONOMIC MODEL. TO WHAT?

SINGAPORE ABIDES BY WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION AND ASEAN (THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS) TRADE RULES, BUT IT'S FAMED FOR ITS LIGHT TOUCH REGULATION - ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCIAL SERVICES - WHICH SOME BREXITEERS FEEL IS THE OPPOSITE OF EU ""MEDDLING"". BUT TURNING A LARGE G7 ECONOMY WITH A ROBUST SOCIAL MODEL INTO A CITY STATE MIGHT BE DIFFICULT. IT MIGHT INVOLVE THE GOVERNMENT HANDPICKING WHICH INDUSTRIES IT THINKS WILL BE SUCCESSES AND RAPIDLY NEGLECTING EXISTING SECTORS. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WOULD NEED TO GET BRAND NEW QUALIFICATIONS WHILE THOSE WITH UNDESIRABLE SKILLS WOULD BECOME SURPLUS TO REQUIREMENTS.

PATIENTS, STAFF AND MANAGEMENT WERE INTERVIEWED. MS HINDS WILL SUBMIT HER REPORT TO THE HEALTH MINISTER SHORTLY. SPEAKING TO THE BBC, SHE SAID THERE NEEDED TO BE A BETTER MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS. WHEN ASKED IF SOME PATIENTS ARE BEING MANAGED IN AN ENVIRONMENT WHICH IS NOT SAFE, SHE SAID: ""THERE SHOULD BE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF NURSES TO LOOK AFTER THE PATIENTS. ""WHEN ADMITTED TO HOSPITAL AND YOU ARE DELAYED IN THE SYSTEM, SOMEONE SHOULD BE APPOINTED TO CARE FOR YOU. ""THERE SHOULD BE SOMEONE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU, FOR MONITORING YOU, AND CARING FOR YOU.""

HOWEVER, MS HINDS CLEARLY LAID OUT WHAT SHOULD BE IN PLACE WHEN A PERSON IS ADMITTED TO AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. ""IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TRY AND FIX IT,"" SHE SAID. ""EVEN TODAY I HAVE CHALLENGED NURSES TO TRY AND SPEAK WITH COURAGE TO HELP FIX THEIR SERVICES EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY GO INTO WORK. ""FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME WE'VE NOW GOT A COMMITMENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT TO SUPPORT NORMAL RANGES OF STAFFING LEVELS FOR NURSING AND THAT IS A FIRST. ""THAT WILL ENSURE SAFE STAFFING LEVELS ACROSS OUR TRUSTS IN NORTHERN IRELAND.

""THE MINISTER IS SHOWING REAL LEADERSHIP,"" SHE SAID. ""HE IS SHOWING THAT HE'S MAKING IT A PRIORITY, HE IS SHOWING THAT PATIENTS BEING DELAYED IN A&E IS UNACCEPTABLE. ""I THINK THERE IS A BRINGING TOGETHER OF ENERGY AND I HOPE THIS NEW ACTION GROUP WHICH HAS BEEN FORMED WILL MAKE THE DIFFERENCE.

IT ADDED: ""WE CONTINUE TO INVESTIGATE THE SITUATION AND ARE EXPLORING ALL POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS AND SOLUTIONS."" IT IS NOT YET CLEAR WHETHER PARITY WILL BE ABLE TO RECTIFY THE MISTAKE.

ESTIMATES OF EXACTLY HOW MUCH OF ETHEREUM'S COINS HAS BEEN FROZEN VARY WIDELY. LOW ESTIMATES PUT THE FIGURE AT $150M BUT OTHERS SUGGEST IT COULD BE AS HIGH AS $300M. THE BUG WAS TRIGGERED WHILE AN UNNAMED DEVELOPER WAS LOOKING THROUGH THE PARITY CODE FOR WAYS THAT IT COULD BE EXPLOITED. ONLY WALLETS CREATED AFTER 20 JULY ARE AFFECTED BECAUSE THEY USE AN UPDATED VERSION OF PARITY'S WALLET PROGRAM ISSUED TO FIX ANOTHER BUG THAT LED TO $30M OF ETHEREUM COINS BEING STOLEN. ETHEREUM IS A CRYPTO-CURRENCY SIMILAR TO BITCOIN THAT USES A LARGE NETWORK OF COMPUTERS TO VERIFY TRANSACTIONS AND GENERATE NEW COINS. CURRENTLY, ONE ETHER DIGITAL COIN IS WORTH ABOUT $314."

entertainment-arts-45395322,Chris Evans: A life in broadcasting,Chris Evans has announced he will be leaving the Radio 2 breakfast show at the end of the year to host Virgin Radio's equivalent.,"HIS DEPARTURE WILL BRING AN END TO THE LATEST CHAPTER IN AN EVENTFUL CAREER THAT HAS BROUGHT HIM FAME, RICHES - AND SOME NOTORIETY. EVANS BUILT HIS REPUTATION AS A WITTY PRANKSTER ON LONDON STATION GLR, WHERE HE STARTED AS A PRODUCER AND ENDED UP AS A STAR DJ. HE SHOT TO FAME IN 1992 AS HOST OF THE BIG BREAKFAST, A RIOTOUS EARLY MORNING PROGRAMME ON CHANNEL 4. THE BIG BREAKFAST WAS A HUGE HIT IN ITS EARLY DAYS, BEATING EVEN GMTV WHEN IT LAUNCHED ON ITV IN 1993. THE WARRINGTON-BORN STAR'S DYNAMIC PERSONALITY DEFINED THE SHOW, WHICH CATAPULTED HIM FROM CULT PERSONALITY TO NATIONAL CELEBRITY. DON'T FORGET YOUR TOOTHBRUSH, HIS FIRST PRIME-TIME TV SHOW, MADE ITS DEBUT ON CHANNEL 4 IN 1994. THE FORMAT FOR THE SHOW - MADE BY GINGER PRODUCTIONS, HIS OWN PRODUCTION OUTFIT - WAS LUCRATIVELY SOLD AROUND THE WORLD. AFTER LEAVING THE BIG BREAKFAST IN 1994, EVANS WAS RECRUITED BY BBC RADIO 1 TO REVAMP THE STATION'S BREAKFAST SHOW. HE ACCEPTED ON THE PROVISO IT WOULD BE IN THE HANDS OF GINGER PRODUCTIONS, AN ARRANGEMENT THE BBC WAS PREPARED TO ACCEPT IN RETURN FOR BUMPER RATINGS. IN 1996 HE RETURNED TO CHANNEL 4 TO LAUNCH TFI FRIDAY, A CLASSIC EVANS COCKTAIL OF LIVE MUSIC, CELEBRITY CHAT, OUTLANDISH STUNTS AND IN-JOKES. YET HE FOUND IT HARD TO JUGGLE IT WITH HIS RADIO 1 DAY JOB, LEADING TO A PARTING OF THE WAYS IN JANUARY 1997 WHEN HIS DEMANDS TO WORK A FOUR-DAY WEEK WERE REFUSED. ""I WAS STUPID, NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT,"" HE ADMITTED IN 2009. ""I WAS UNGRATEFUL. I HAD THIS BRILLIANT CAREER AND MESSED IT UP."" EVANS WAS NOT OFF AIR FOR LONG. LATER THAT YEAR HE RETURNED TO BREAKFAST RADIO, ON SIR RICHARD BRANSON'S VIRGIN STATION. HE LIKED THE JOB SO MUCH HE BOUGHT VIRGIN RADIO FROM SIR RICHARD AT THE END OF 1997. BUT THE EVANS MAGIC STARTED TO FADE SOON AFTERWARDS. HE WAS PHOTOGRAPHED OUT ON THE TOWN WITH PAUL GASCOIGNE, DAMAGING THE FOOTBALLER'S CHANCES OF GETTING INTO THE ENGLAND SQUAD FOR THE 1998 WORLD CUP. TFI FRIDAY STARTED TO GO OFF THE BOIL, WHILE TWO BBC PROJECTS, THE NATIONAL LOTTERY-BASED RED ALERT AND STUDENT QUIZ CARRY ON CAMPUS, FLOPPED. THAT DID NOT STOP HIM SELLING HIS GINGER MEDIA GROUP TO THE SCOTTISH MEDIA GROUP (SMG) FOR £225 MILLION IN EARLY 2000. YET THINGS SOON TURNED SOUR AT VIRGIN. EVANS FAILED TO TURN UP FOR A WEEK OF BREAKFAST SHOWS AND THE STATION IGNORED HIS CLAIM THAT HE HAD BEEN ILL. PHOTOGRAPHS AND FOOTAGE HAD EMERGED OF HIM OUT DRINKING WITH POP STAR BILLIE PIPER, PROMPTING VIRGIN TO DISMISS HIM. EVANS SAID THE TERMINATION OF HIS CONTRACT COST HIM £3 MILLION IN LOST SHARE PAY-OUTS. YET HE ULTIMATELY LOST HIS CASE AGAINST HIS FORMER STATION. HE AND PIPER MARRIED IN 2001 AND MOVED TO LOS ANGELES. BUT THEIR UNION DID NOT LAST AND THEY DIVORCED IN 2007. EVANS WOULD EVENTUALLY RETURN TO THE BBC IN 2005 TO PRESENT AFTERNOON SHOWS ON RADIO 2. AFTER MOVING TO DRIVETIME IN 2006, HE WAS NAMED AS SIR TERRY WOGAN'S SUCCESSOR IN THE COVETED BREAKFAST SLOT IN 2009. THE FOLLOWING YEAR HE MOVED BACK TO PRIME-TIME TELEVISION BY CO-PRESENTING BBC ONE'S THE ONE SHOW ON FRIDAY EVENINGS. EVANS WENT ON TO BECOME ONE OF THE BBC'S TOP EARNERS, WITH FIGURES LAST YEAR REVEALING HE BROUGHT IN BETWEEN £2.2M AND £2.25M. THIS WAS PARTLY DUE TO HIM CO-HOSTING BBC ONE'S TOP GEAR FOLLOWING THE DEPARTURE OF JEREMY CLARKSON, RICHARD HAMMOND AND JAMES MAY. EVANS, A WELL-KNOWN PETROLHEAD AND EXPERIENCED BROADCASTER, WAS SEEN AS A SAFE BET TO TAKE OVER THE HELM OF THE BBC'S FLAGSHIP MOTORING SHOW. YET RATINGS PLUMMETED, AND THE PRESENTER WAS FORCED TO APOLOGISE FOR AN ILL-ADVISED STUNT FILMED AROUND A MONUMENT TO BRITAIN'S WAR DEAD. EVANS LEFT TOP GEAR AFTER ONE SERIES, CONCENTRATING INSTEAD ON HIS RADIO 2 SHOW AND HIS TWO CHILDREN WITH THIRD WIFE NATASHA SHISHMANIAN. ONE OF THE SHOW'S MOST POPULAR INITIATIVES IS 500 WORDS, A STORY-WRITING COMPETITION FOR CHILDREN NOW IN ITS EIGHTH YEAR. EARLIER THIS YEAR EVANS REVEALED THAT HE AND NATASHA, A PROFESSIONAL GOLFER AND COLUMNIST, WERE EXPECTING TWINS. SPECULATION IS MOUNTING OVER WHO WILL REPLACE HIM NOW HE HAS CHOSEN TO BRING THE CURTAIN DOWN ON HIS 13 YEARS AT RADIO 2.

AS THE PANDEMIC STRUCK LAST SPRING, THERE WAS A SCRAMBLE TO ENSURE THAT HOSPITALS AND OTHER CARE SETTINGS HAD ADEQUATE SUPPLIES OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE).

'SHADOW STATE' DURING HER SPEECH, MS REEVES ALSO CALLED ON MINISTERS TO END EMERGENCY PROCUREMENT RULES BROUGHT IN AT THE START OF THE PANDEMIC, WHICH HAVE STREAMLINED THE NORMAL BIDDING PROCESS FOR CONTRACTS.

uk-38182298,Child car seats: Will you be affected by rule changes?,New rules on child car seats are set to come into force after March next year and have left many parents confused about what they need to use.,"CHANGES ARE BEING MADE TO THE WEIGHT AND HEIGHT AT WHICH A CHILD WILL BE ALLOWED TO USE A BACKLESS BOOSTER SEAT. HOWEVER, PARENTS WILL NOT NEED TO REPLACE CAR SEATS THEY HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT BECAUSE THEY CAN CONTINUE TO USE THEM. WHAT IS CHANGING? FROM NEXT YEAR, CHANGES ARE BEING MADE ON THE RULES REGARDING BACKLESS BOOSTER SEATS. CURRENTLY, PARENTS CAN USE THESE TYPES OF SEATS FOR CHILDREN WHO WEIGH 15KG (2ST 5LBS) AND ABOVE - TYPICALLY AGED THREE AND OVER. THE NEW RULES WILL MEAN ONLY CHILDREN WEIGHING OVER 22KG (3ST 7LBS) WHO ARE ALSO OVER 125CM (4FT 1INS) TALL CAN USE THE SEATS. THE UNITED NATIONS, WHICH SETS THE SAFETY STANDARDS FOR CAR SEATS, HAS APPROVED THE CHANGE WHICH MUST NOW BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE EU. THE GOVERNMENT SAID THE EARLIEST THE NEW RULES WILL COME IN IS MARCH 2017 AND THEY WILL AFFECT THE WHOLE OF THE UK. WHY BRING IN THE NEW RULES? MANY CHILD CAR SEAT EXPERTS SAY THEY ARE UNSUITABLE FOR SMALL CHILDREN AS THE CHILD IS NOT HELD AS SECURELY IN THE SEAT, THE ADULT SEATBELT IS NOT GUIDED ACROSS THEIR BODY IN THE BEST WAY AND THEY OFFER LITTLE PROTECTION IF A CAR IS INVOLVED IN A SIDE-ON CRASH. WHAT IF YOU HAVE ALREADY BOUGHT ONE? DO NOT WORRY. THE CHANGES WILL ONLY APPLY TO NEW BACKLESS SEATS AND NOT ONES ALREADY ON THE MARKET THAT MEET CURRENT SAFETY STANDARDS. PARENTS CAN CONTINUE TO USE THEIR CURRENT MODEL AFTER THE RULE CHANGE AND WILL NOT NEED TO BUY A NEW ONE. IT WILL BE DOWN TO MANUFACTURERS OF NEW SEATS TO ENSURE THEY MEET THE REVISED SAFETY STANDARDS AND ARE LABELLED CORRECTLY. WHAT IS THE CURRENT LAW? CHILDREN MUST USE A CHILD CAR SEAT UNTIL THEY ARE 12 YEARS OLD OR 135CM (4FT 5IN) TALL, WHICHEVER COMES FIRST. THERE ARE TYPICALLY THREE TYPES OF CHILDREN'S CAR SEATS: ONLY EU-APPROVED CHILD CAR SEATS CAN BE USED IN THE UK - WHICH HAVE A LABEL SHOWING A CAPITAL ""E"" IN A CIRCLE. PARENTS SHOULD TYPICALLY CHOOSE A CAR SEAT BASED ON THEIR CHILD'S HEIGHT OR WEIGHT. A DRIVER CAN BE FINED UP TO £500 IF A CHILD UNDER 14 DOES NOT WEAR A SEAT BELT OR CHILD RESTRAINT. ANYONE 14 AND OVER NOT WEARING A SEAT BELT MUST PAY THE FINE THEMSELVES. THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, CHILDREN CAN TRAVEL WITHOUT A CHILD CAR SEAT IN A TAXI OR MINICAB IF THEY TRAVEL ON A REAR SEAT AND WEAR AN ADULT SEAT BELT IF THEY ARE AGED THREE OR OLDER OR WITHOUT A SEAT BELT IF THEY ARE UNDER THREE. WHICH SEAT SHOULD YOU HAVE? MANY PARENTS THINK THEY CAN JUDGE WHICH CAR SEAT THEY NEED TO BUY BASED ON THEIR CHILD'S AGE BUT IT SHOULD ONLY BE USED AS GUIDANCE. CAR SEATS ARE TYPICALLY CATEGORISED ACCORDING TO HEIGHT AND WEIGHT. HEIGHT-BASED CAR SEATS, KNOWN AS ""I-SIZE"" SEATS, MUST BE REAR-FACING UNTIL THE CHILD IS OVER 15 MONTHS OLD. FOR WEIGHT-BASED CAR SEATS, THE TYPE DEPENDS ON HOW HEAVY A CHILD IS. A MORE DETAILED LIST IS AVAILABLE THROUGH CHILDCARSEATS.ORG.UK"

WELLS FARGO, THE BIGGEST US MORTGAGE LENDER, ALSO REPORTED RESULTS ON FRIDAY. IT REPORTED A RECORD NET INCOME OF $5.3BN IN THE THIRD QUARTER, UP 13% ON THE SAME PERIOD IN 2012. THAT RISE CAME DESPITE A FALL IN INCOME AT ITS MORTGAGE BUSINESS, WHERE REVENUE FELL 43% TO $1.6BN. THE FALL WAS OFFSET BY LOWER EXPENSES AND A REDUCTION IN FUNDS SET ASIDE FOR LOANS GOING BAD. LEGAL TROUBLE JP MORGAN NOW HAS A CONTINGENCY FUND OF $23BN TO COVER LEGAL EXPENSES. IT ALSO SAID THAT IT COULD FACE LITIGATION-RELATED EXPENSES OF ANOTHER $6.8BN. IT IS CURRENTLY IN TALKS WITH THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OVER A POTENTIALLY HUGE SETTLEMENT, RELATED TO THE MIS-SELLING OF MORTGAGE RELATED PRODUCTS DURING THE US HOUSING BOOM. IT IS THOUGHT THE SETTLEMENT COULD COST AS MUCH AS $11BN. MR DIMON STRESSED ON FRIDAY THAT MUCH OF THE CASE RELATED TO DEALS DONE BY BEAR STEARNS AND WASHINGTON MUTUAL, COMPANIES THAT JP MORGAN CHASE BOUGHT DURING THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. ""THE BOARD CONTINUES TO SEEK A FAIR AND REASONABLE SETTLEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT ON MORTGAGE-RELATED ISSUES AND ONE THAT RECOGNISES THE EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE BEAR STEARNS AND WASHINGTON MUTUAL TRANSACTIONS, WHICH WERE UNDERTAKEN AT THE REQUEST OR ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE US GOVERNMENT,"" HE SAID. LAST MONTH, JP MORGAN PAID $920M TO SETTLE A CASE RELATED TO DISASTROUS TRADES BY BRUNO IKSIL, WHO EARNED THE NICKNAME THE ""LONDON WHALE"" FOR HIS BIG BETS ON THE FINANCIAL MARKETS. LAST YEAR, THE BANK ADMITTED TO LOSSES OF $6.2BN RESULTING FROM HIS ACTIVITIES. AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT DEAL, JP MORGAN ADMITTED VIOLATING US FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS."
world-middle-east-55949391,Israel's Netanyahu enters plea in court in corruption trial,Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied corruption charges in court for the first time as his trial resumes in Jerusalem.,"MR NETANYAHU ENTERED HIS PLEA AT THE HEARING WHICH HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY POSTPONED BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. HE IS THE FIRST SERVING ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER TO GO ON TRIAL, WHICH TAKES PLACE JUST A MONTH BEFORE ELECTIONS. MR NETANYAHU, 71, IS ACCUSED OF BRIBERY, FRAUD AND BREACH OF TRUST IN THREE SEPARATE CASES. HUNDREDS OF PROTESTERS GATHERED OUTSIDE THE DISTRICT COURTHOUSE AHEAD OF THE PRIME MINISTER'S BRIEF APPEARANCE ON MONDAY MORNING, MAKING NOISE, WAVING BANNERS AND CALLING FOR HIM TO RESIGN. MR NETANYAHU HAD URGED SUPPORTERS NOT TO COME TO COURT BECAUSE OF THE THREAT OF CORONAVIRUS. THE PRIME MINISTER ARRIVED FOR THE HEARING WEARING A BLACK PROTECTIVE MASK. INSIDE THE COURTROOM HE ROSE TO REJECT THE CHARGES, BEFORE DEPARTING WITHIN 45 MINUTES WHILE HIS LAWYERS CONTINUED DELIBERATIONS. WHAT IS BENJAMIN NETANYAHU ACCUSED OF? MR NETANYAHU HAS BEEN INDICTED IN THREE CASES, KNOWN AS 1,000, 2,000 AND 4,000: MR NETANYAHU HAS CONSISTENTLY DENIED ALL THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM, BRANDING THEM A ""WITCH-HUNT"" BY POLITICAL OPPONENTS, AND HAS VOWED TO CLEAR HIS NAME. HOW CAN THE PM SERVE AND STAND TRIAL AT THE SAME TIME? ACCORDING TO ISRAELI LAW, A LEADER CHARGED WITH A CRIME IS NOT REQUIRED TO RESIGN. BUT THERE IS NO PRECEDENT. A FORMER PRIME MINISTER, EHUD OLMERT, STEPPED DOWN AS PARTY LEADER WHEN HE WAS UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR CORRUPTION IN 2008 BUT TECHNICALLY REMAINED PRIME MINISTER UNTIL ELECTIONS THE FOLLOWING YEAR - POLLS WHICH BROUGHT BENJAMIN NETANYAHU TO POWER. WHAT DOES THE TRIAL MEAN FOR THE COUNTRY? IN SHORT, A SERVING PRIME MINISTER OCCUPYING THE MOST POWERFUL OFFICE IN THE LAND SIMULTANEOUSLY TRYING TO CLEAR HIS NAME AND AVOID JAIL-TIME. IT COMES JUST SIX WEEKS BEFORE ISRAELIS GO TO THE POLLS IN WHAT IS EXPECTED TO BE A CLOSE-FOUGHT ELECTION. WHILE MR NETANYAHU'S OWN LIKUD PARTY HAS STOOD BEHIND HIM, POLITICAL OPPONENTS HAVE TRIED TO MAXIMISE THE PRIME MINISTER'S LEGAL DIFFICULTIES, CLAIMING HE IS UNFIT TO HOLD OFFICE. MR NETANYAHU HAS THOUGH PREVIOUSLY SUCCESSFULLY FOUGHT THREE ELECTIONS SINCE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS INTO HIM BEGAN IN 2016. EVEN IF HE IS CONVICTED AND IS STILL IN POWER, MR NETANYAHU WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO RESIGN UNLESS AND UNTIL ANY APPEALS ARE EXHAUSTED - WHICH COULD, IN THEORY, BE MANY MONTHS OR YEARS INTO THE FUTURE. IN EHUD OLMERT'S CASE, THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER WENT ON TRIAL IN 2009 AND AFTER HE WAS CONVICTED ONLY BEGAN SERVING HIS SENTENCE IN 2016 DUE TO THE LONG LEGAL PROCESS."
