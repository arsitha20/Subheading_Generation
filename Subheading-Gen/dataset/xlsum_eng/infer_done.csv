The CBSO will perform his Violin Concerto as part of Wednesday evening's event. The charity is core funded by Arts Council England and the city council. 'Next generation' The special concert will include Strauss's Suite from Der Rosenkavalier and Haydn's Symphony No. 90. Audience members have been invited to join the music director, Latvian Andris Nelsons, and the orchestra for a special birthday party. Mr Nelsons became music director in 2008, following in the footsteps of Adrian Boult, Louis Fremaux and Sir Simon Rattle. He will continue Birmingham's Mahler cycle with four performances of the composer's Symphony No. 5. Two will be held in the city on 23 and 24 November with two taking place in his home city of Riga on 26 and 27 November on the CBSO's first ever trip to Latvia. The orchestra, which had Symphony added to its name in 1948, held its first concert at Birmingham Town Hall and performed the majority of its concerts there from 1920 to 1991. The CBSO has five choruses, a youth orchestra and an education and outreach programme which ""reaches out to the next generation of music lovers"", it said. Birthday celebrations started with more than 30 concerts being held at schools in October.

uk-37239256,Thousands of children reported over indecent images,"More than 2,000 children were reported to police in three years over indecent images, the NSPCC says.","The children's charity submitted a Freedom of Information request spanning 2013-15 to police across the UK. This showed 2,031 under-18s were reported for crimes linked to the possession, distribution, or production of indecent images of children. NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said children had to be educated about staying safe both offline and online. The law states that making or sharing indecent photographs of anyone aged under the age of 18 could be classed as an offence - but there have been calls for recording rules to be adapted so children are not routinely criminalised. The NSPCC sent the 45 police forces across the UK an FOI in May, and found the total offences of this nature recorded, regardless of age, were 4,530 in 2013, 6,303 in 2014, and 10,818 in 2015. Not all police forces provided age breakdowns, but for those which did, there were 11,697 investigations where the age of the defendant was recorded and 2,031 were under the age of 18. Image 'explosion' The charity also said that, of the 1,000 parents and carers from across the UK who took part in a recent online survey, only half of parents knew that children taking nude selfies were committing a crime. Mr Wanless said recent advances in digital technology has fuelled an ""explosion in the production and consumption of child sexual abuse images"" that increasingly involves live video streaming. He added: ""As well as pursuing and deterring adults who make and distribute these we must educate children about how to keep themselves safe online and offline and how to get help as soon as grooming or abuse happens. ""And every child who is the victim of exploitation and abuse should get the support they need to rebuild their lives."" And he said that the internet industry must prioritise this issue by working with the public and voluntary sector. In September, the BBC learned that a boy who sent a naked photograph of himself to a girl at school had the crime of making and distributing indecent images recorded against him by police. The boy, aged 14, who was not arrested or charged, could have his name stored on a police database for 10 years.","children's charity submitted a Freedom of Information request spanning 2013-15 to police across the UK.

science-environment-40889934,Climate change has shifted the timing of European floods,"Climate change has had a significant impact on the timing of river floods across Europe over the past 50 years, according to a new study.","By Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent In some regions, such as southern England, floods are now occurring 15 days earlier than they did half a century ago. But the changes aren't uniform, with rivers around the North Sea seeing floods delayed by around eight days. The study has been published in the journal Science. Floods caused by rivers impact more people than any other natural hazard, and the estimated global damages run to over a $100bn a year. Researchers have long predicted that a warming world would have direct impacts on these events but until now the evidence has been hard to establish. Floods are affected by many different factors in addition to rainfall, such as the amount of moisture already in the soil and other questions such as changes in land-use that can speed up water run-off from hillsides. This new study looks at this issue in some depth, by creating a Europe-wide database of observations from 4,262 hydrometric stations in 38 countries, dating back to 1960. The analysis finds a clear but complex impact of climate change on river flooding. The most consistent changes are in north-eastern Europe around Scandinavia where earlier snow melt due to warmer temperatures is leading to earlier spring floods. Around 50% of monitoring stations are seeing floods eight days earlier than they did 50 years ago. The biggest changes are seen along the western edge of Europe, from Portugal up to Southern England. Half the stations recorded floods at least 15 days earlier than previously. A quarter of the stations saw flooding more than 36 days earlier than in 1960. In these regions, the issue isn't snow melt - it's more about saturated soils. Maximum rainfall tends to occur in the autumn and gets stored in the soils. Heavier and earlier rain means that the groundwater reaches capacity earlier. ""It's the interplay between extreme rainfall and the abundance of rainfall,"" lead author Prof Günter Blöschl, from the Technical University of Vienna, told BBC News. ""In southern England, it has been raining more, longer and more intensely than in the past. This has created a rising groundwater table and higher soil moisture than usual and combined with intense rainfall this produces earlier river floods."" However, around the North Sea, in the Netherlands, Denmark and Scotland, the trend is towards later floods. The scientists believe this is due to changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the weather phenomenon that pushes storms across the ocean into Europe. The NAO is driven by differences in atmospheric pressure between the North Pole and the Equator. Recent, rapid changes in temperatures in the Arctic are interfering with these pressure levels and changing the track of the oscillation and storms as well. According to this study, the storms are arriving later and as a result some river flooding happens later too. Prof Blöschl says that this study shows clear evidence of the impact of human-induced climate change in many regions - but there are still some areas of uncertainty. ""Where the human imprint is obvious is in the northeast of Europe. It is quite a direct link, with a warming climate and earlier snow melt,"" he said. ""However, the areas impacted by the NAO are more difficult to attribute to anthropogenic global warming. The jury is still out on that aspect."" The study foresees subtle but significant impacts that could arise from the change in flood timing. There could be effects on river ecosystems with salmon spawning later in the year. There could also be implications for hydropower stations, and for agriculture if fields stay wetter for longer. ""The more serious concern is that if warming impacts the seasonality it may also impact the scale of flooding,"" said Prof Blöschl. ""You could think of timing changes as the harbinger of future changes of flood magnitude. That is the more serious concern. If that happens, flood risk management will have to adapt and that will be different in different parts of Europe."" Other experts believe that the changes in flood timing identified by this study have significant implications for how we understand the risk of river floods and how we deal with them. ""Nearly every major city and town in Europe is built on a river and we protect this urban infrastructure by using past floods as a gauge of the potential risk,"" said Mark Maslin, Professor of Climatology at University College London. ""The study shows that this approach underestimates the risk, as climate change has made European floods occur earlier in the year, increasing their potential impact. ""This means all the infrastructure that we have built to protect our cities needs to be reviewed as much of it will be inadequate to protect us from future climate change-induced extreme flooding.""

education-42707654,Is social mobility really about school cash?,"If you took a list of the top 20 places in England where schools have the most funding, 18 of them would be in London.","Sean CoughlanEducation correspondent And if you took another list, of the top 20 places with the highest level of social mobility, 17 of them would also be in London. Is that a coincidence? Head teachers in the Worth Less? campaign over school funding shortages say that if the government is serious about promoting social mobility in education, then it needs to look at how low funding seems to mirror low mobility. West Somerset has the lowest place on the government's social mobility index - and is also one of the lowest-funded areas. The Worth Less? campaign, which has brought together about 5,000 schools over the issue of fair funding, has produced an analysis showing that a secondary school in West Somerset would receive £2m less per year than a similar sized school in Westminster. Westminster, in the top 10 for funding, is rated as giving its disadvantaged young people the highest chance of social mobility in the country. And a key aspect of the success of London's schools has been that poorer youngsters, such as those eligible for free school meals, do much better in the capital than elsewhere. Funding gaps Of course, there are many other crosswinds in such a complex topic. Schools in London get more funding because they have bigger challenges - extra costs because of their location and extra demands, such as high levels of deprivation and many pupils speaking English as a second language. It has often been claimed that London has its own demographic microclimate, with many migrant families arriving with high ambitions for their children. But head teachers argue that there's no escaping the overlap between social mobility and financial support. None of the lowest-funded 20 authorities makes it into the top 50 for social mobility. And the top 10s for funding and social mobility are shuffling very similar packs. Top 10 for funding Top 10 for social mobility Jules White, a head teacher from West Sussex who has co-ordinated the Worth Less? school funding campaign, is calling for a much closer look at what the variation in funding really means for those outside the capital. The funding gap between West Somerset and Westminster, for an individual school, is the equivalent of dozens of extra teaching staff, after-school clubs, university links, careers advice and support for pupils who are struggling. And these are exactly the kinds of added extras that could improve social mobility. Mr White, speaking at a Westminster Education Forum event on school funding, has broken down the figures to per-pupil spending. Barnsley, near the bottom for social mobility, has £4,729 for each secondary pupil, while Hackney, in the top five for social mobility, receives £7,840. How much could schools in Barnsley help their young people with an extra £1,000 per term for each of them? Or what more progress could be supported in other areas on the bottom rungs for funding, such as York, Leicestershire and West Sussex. But it's not always such a neat match between funding and social mobility. Nottingham and Manchester are among areas that are relatively well-funded, but don't do particularly well on social mobility. Tightrope act The Westminster forum on funding heard warnings that the answer was not taking money from schools in the capital. A chair of governors from a secondary school in Lambeth said that the changes proposed in the new national funding formula would leave them with a budget deficit heading towards £500,000, which could only be resolved by significant cuts in the teaching staff. Valentine Mulholland, of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the funding squeeze had already meant the loss of jobs for teaching and support staff. And a study from the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) suggested higher spending particularly benefited disadvantaged pupils. New Education Secretary Damian Hinds has made a priority of social mobility - but he will also have to make some big decisions about the pressure over school funding. The Department for Education has consistently argued that there are record levels of funding - and the NFER's Ben Durbin agreed that by international standards, England's schools are relatively well-funded. The political tightrope act for ministers is to push more cash to the less well-funded areas without damaging those schools performing well in better-funded places. But the head teachers are arguing that funding and social mobility should no longer be seen as separate conversations.","남자가an CoughlanEducation correspondent And if you took another list, of the top 20 places with the highest level of social mobility, 17 of them would also be in London.

uk-england-manchester-13699084,Macclesfield's Richard Butcher died from heart condition,"A professional footballer who was found dead in his bed died from a rare heart condition, a coroner has ruled.","Macclesfield Town midfielder Richard Butcher was discovered dead at his flat in Swinton, Salford in January. The Northampton-born player, 29, had suffered chest pains in the past three years, Bolton Coroner's Court heard. In a narrative verdict, assistant deputy coroner Peter Watson said Mr Butcher died from natural causes due to a naturally occurring heart condition. ""All deaths are tragic but especially in cases with someone so young and on the face of things he was a very fit and healthy young man, it is so sad that on the balance of probabilities he died from this cardiac condition,"" Mr Watson said. 'Fit and professional' A post-mortem examination showed he died of natural causes and there were no signs of heart disease. The player suffered from the condition cardiac arrhythmia - where the heart either beats too slow or too fast. Mr Butcher's wife Sarah told the hearing he ""dedicated his career to maintaining his health and fitness"". ""He used to delight in that the younger players would remark on how fit and professional he was,"" she said. Mrs Butcher said her husband had complained of chest pains on and off for about three years. ""Every now and then he would clutch his chest and then the pain would disappear,"" she said. 'No pain' ""He would say 'I'm so fit and healthy, it's fine' and he would dismiss it really."" He underwent a series of heart tests in Lincoln in November 2009, after collapsing after a night out when he had only drunk three bottles of beer. Mrs Butcher said that he clutched his chest while working on a university assignment at his computer three days before his death, but again had shrugged it off. Pathologist Dr Simon Suvarna said such deaths were rare and that either they occurred with no warning or with previous symptoms of fainting episodes. Chest pains were not common as an indicator, he said. He said the death may have happened while Mr Butcher was asleep or had just woken but he would not have been aware or felt any pain. Mr Butcher, who also played for Kettering, Oldham, Peterborough, Notts County and Lincoln City, was described by Macclesfield Town as ""a total role model for young professionals"". The club, where he had played for a year, were concerned when he did not arrive for training on 10 January. He was later found dead. Paying tribute, his father Richard said: ""He was a lovely, lovely lad. As fit as anything. ""He always wanted to be a footballer, like every schoolboy does."" His brother Glenn added: ""I couldn't imagine him doing another job. He tried a couple of times having normal jobs but he never lasted more than a day.""

business-36311126,UK inflation rate falls on cheaper air fares,"The UK's inflation rate fell in April for the first time since September, largely because of cheaper air fares after the Easter holidays.","The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index, fell to 0.3%. The ONS said the main causes were falls in the prices of air fares, vehicles, clothing and social housing rents. The Bank of England said last week that it expected inflation to increase in the second half of the year. By far the largest downward effect in April came from air transport, with prices falling by 14.2%, compared with a rise of 4.5% between the same two months last year. This was influenced by the timing of the Easter holidays in March. Fare prices increased dramatically between February and March this year and then fell sharply in April. The price of clothing and footwear also fell as retailers dropped prices to try to revive sales hit by last month's cold weather. An alternative inflation measure, the Retail Prices Index, which is still used to index some rents and pensions, also fell from an annual rate of 1.6% in March to 1.3% in April. Meanwhile core inflation, which strips out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, fell to 1.2%, compared with economists' expectations for 1.4%. Interest rates Last week, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, had to write his sixth letter to the Chancellor George Osborne explaining why CPI inflation was still below the Bank's 2% target. In it he said: ""The underlying causes of the below-target inflation of the past year and a half have been: sharp falls in commodity prices, the past appreciation of sterling, and to a lesser degree the subdued pace of domestic cost growth."" The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted last week to keep interest rates unchanged at the record low of 0.5%. The Bank is not expected to raise rates until at least next year. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said: ""We are likely to see inflation remain close to current rates until the latter part of the year, when the base effects associated with last winter's collapse in the oil price will begin to kick in and finally drag the CPI measure above 1%. Such a benign outlook is likely to stay the MPC's hand until well into next year."" In a separate report, the ONS said that there had been a surge in house prices as landlords rushed to buy before higher stamp duty was imposed. UK average house prices increased by 9.0% over the year to March 2016, up from 7.6% in the year to February 2016.

business-26891682,Why bamboo is booming again in Taiwan,"Bamboo is ubiquitous in Chinese culture. Sturdy and tenacious, it symbolises virtue.","By Cindy SuiBBC, Taipei In fact, the plant has had a profound impact on the daily life, culture and spirituality of the Chinese. In the past, a wide variety of products were made from bamboo - from roof tiles and rafts, to shoes, furniture and agricultural tools. But despite the close relationship between Chinese-speaking societies and the natural material, Taiwan's bamboo industry has suffered a decline in recent decades. It nearly collapsed because of people's preference for more modern-looking products, or just cheaper plastic goods - and the impact of less expensive bamboo imports from China and South East Asia. Nowhere was this more apparent than in central Taiwan's Zhushan or ""Bamboo Mountain"" town. Hundreds of families used to make bamboo products there in the centre of the country's bamboo industry. Now there are only about 50. It's a trend reflected in other parts of Taiwan - only about 240 bamboo-products businesses remain on the island. ""In the past, every part of Taiwan had people working in this industry, but over the years, bamboo has been replaced by plastic or steel to make all sorts of products, such as clothes hanging poles, baby cribs, and furniture,"" says Yang Chun-hsien, director of the Forestry Bureau's reforestation and production division. However, an earthquake and strong resolve on the part of the government and industry to continue using bamboo have led to a revival and transformation in its use. In recent years, bamboo has been used to make items never before associated with the plant - from shampoo and insect repellent, to socks, gloves, and even roasted peanuts. This reinvention of how bamboo is used has made it possible for the small family businesses which make up the industry to stay alive and to start reversing the decades of decline. Health benefits? At the height of bamboo production in Taiwan in the 1970s, more than 13 million stalks were harvested each year, and sales of the stalks alone - not including the finished products - amounted to $3.5m (£2.1m) per annum. But in the past decade, the annual harvest amounted to only about 1.67 million stalks with sales adding up to just $456,000 - a little over 10% of the peak level. Production and sales, however, have been steadily climbing in recent years. Following a devastating earthquake on 21 September 1999 centred in Nantou county, where Zhushan lies, the central government decided to help the local economy by commissioning the country's non-profit Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) to find new ways to help the bamboo industry grow. ITRI developed a method to carbonise bamboo stalks to produce high quality bamboo charcoal, which has a multitude of different uses. Naturally insulating, the charcoal can be turned into fibres and woven into fabric to make hats, scarves, gloves, socks and pants. Also said to be health giving, it is increasingly added to bodycare products, such as skin creams. Meanwhile, in industry it is used to purify water and air. Yet its most unusual application has to be in the production of bamboo charcoal-coated peanuts - which look exactly as they sound - peanuts covered with charcoal. Many people who have never tasted them are queasy about giving them a try, but they actually taste good, not at all like charcoal, and are believed to have health benefits. Such diversification has bought new hope to Taiwan's bamboo industry. ""When I was growing up, the toys we played with were made of bamboo,"" says Chen Ching-fu, general manager of the Bamboo Culture Park in Zhushan - a manufacturer of bamboo product, and the first visitor attraction in Taiwan devoted to the plant. ""Bamboo was all around us, but never did we imagine bamboo can be used to make so many different types of products."" Like other businesses, Mr Chen's now sells not only traditional bamboo furniture, but other products such as air fresheners and clothing. Besides bamboo charcoal, the Taiwanese have also found ways to use the actual bamboo to make a much wider variety of products than their ancestors did, including floor panels, pens, clothes hangers and even laptop casings. Sales of goods made from all forms of bamboo in Taiwan now reach $100m, with exports increasing alongside domestic sales. New spin One of the trends helping to drive the revival of the industry is the return of second or third generation young people to help run family businesses. Lin Li-wei, 36, worked at a post office in the capital Taipei after graduating from college. But, making only about $600 a month, he came back to assist his father, who made bamboo ear diggers used by Chinese and Japanese people to remove earwax. He's now put a new spin on the family business - making modern looking clocks, lamps and wall lights out of bamboo. He has been receiving orders for his creations. ""My father supports me trying to innovate,"" says Mr Lin. ""Only through innovations can we add value to our products and continue our business."" Now he and his father make $5,000 a month. Many of the manufacturers in Zhushan are breaking even, but not making big profits. Still, they persevere, seeing it as their mission to continue to promote the use of bamboo. Bamboo grows fast - just five years to reach maturity, making it one of the most environmentally-friendly plants to use. So growers and industry leaders hope they can replace the use of many types of other wood, and plastic. ""Plastic is very cheap and can be used for a longer time, but what a shame. Bamboo is more environmentally friendly, no chemicals are used to make bamboo products, and the trees grow without the need for fertiliser or pesticides,"" said the Forestry Bureau's Mr Yang. ""Bamboo can also absorb a lot of carbon dioxide and can reduce greenhouse gases."" Back at the Bamboo Culture Park, Mr Chen has created a do-it-yourself workshop where schoolchildren and other tourists can learn how bamboo charcoal is made and make their own bamboo products. ""Taiwan can't be without bamboo because it's a material we've relied on for generations,"" says Mr Chen. ""I want to help people understand the importance and benefits of using bamboo.""

She added: ""He basically has made a number of comments yesterday that helped to fuel that violence and he didn't actually do anything to de-escalate that whatsoever... what we've seen is completely unacceptable."" The home secretary added that America ""needs to move on"" and have the transition of power from Mr Trump to Mr Biden. A woman died after being shot by police, and three others died as a result of ""medical emergencies"", local police said. Politicians across the UK's political parties lined up to condemn the scenes in Washington. Mr Johnson tweeted: ""The United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was a ""direct attack on democracy,"" whilst Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called the events ""utterly horrifying"". Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said there was ""no justification for these violent attempts to frustrate the lawful and proper transition of power"". But senior Welsh Conservative Andrew RT Davies has been criticised after comparing the rioting to politicians who supported a second referendum on Brexit. Mr Davies, a member of the Welsh Parliament, later tweeted that ""violence must never be tolerated"". Friend of President Trump and leader of Reform UK - formerly the Brexit Party - Nigel Farage tweeted: ""Storming Capitol Hill is wrong. The protesters must leave."" President Trump later called on his supporters to ""go home"", while continuing to make false claims of electoral fraud. Twitter and Facebook later froze his accounts. Meanwhile, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has defended the prime minister's response to the rioting. Asked on ITV's Peston programme why Mr Johnson hadn't criticised Mr Trump, she said: ""The prime minister has been clear tonight that we need a peaceful and orderly transition."" It is a truism of British diplomacy that every occupant of 10 Downing Street has to get on with every occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, regardless of their politics or character. Personal consideration is pushed aside. What matters is the national interest and staying close to one of Britain's closest allies. Thus even now, even after Donald Trump's incitement of the Capitol mob, even though there are less than two weeks until the inauguration, even as close Republican allies jump ship, Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab were reluctant to criticise the president by name in their initial response overnight. Yes, they condemned the violence. But of Mr Trump, not a word. This caution was matched by the prime ministers of fellow so-called Five Eyes intelligence allies, Australia and New Zealand, both of whom also both failed to mention Mr Trump in their condemnatory tweets. In contrast, European leaders were quick to blame the President personally. It was only this morning that a British minister, Home Secretary Priti Patel, felt able to follow suit in strong terms. So was this natural and sensible diplomatic caution in the midst of a febrile crisis? Or was this, as some Labour figures are already claiming, a function of the closeness between the current UK government and the Trump administration? It was only a few weeks ago that the Defence Secretary, Ben Wallace, told The Sun that he would miss Donald Trump because he was a good friend to Britain. Whatever one's views, it is certainly the case that the British government is seen on the international stage by some has having ideological proximity to Mr Trump. Changing that reputation is seen by many diplomats as a priority in the months ahead, a task made more urgent by events overnight.",our people have died after a pro-Trump mob stormed the building in a bid to overturn the election result.

McDonnell, of Chorley Road, Standish, also admitted he falsely claimed membership of the Home Builders Federation. An expert witness said it was the ""worst"" case he had ever seen McDonnell not only carried out substandard work he conned his victims with fake claims that it had passed building inspections when none had taken place. Three customers, including the mother of Wigan Rugby League legend Shaun Edwards, paid out more than £200,000, said Lancashire Trading Standards. Angela Cartwright, 50, from Wrightington, Lancashire, said her husband invested his pension and the couple ploughed their life savings into the building work carried out by McDonnell. ""This is not just a dodgy builder - he grabs the money, leaves you with a mess and your dreams shattered,"" said Mrs Cartwright. Ms Cartwright said their home in High Moor Lane was condemned by a surveyor after he saw McDonnell's work. ""There's no damp proof course, the walls are built with a brick that doesn't hold the weight of the roof, basically the roof, the walls and the floor have to be taken down so we will not be able to live here,"" she said.

uk-politics-45462900,Boris Johnson compares Chequers deal to 'suicide vest',"Boris Johnson has attacked Theresa's May's Brexit plan, saying she had ""wrapped a suicide vest"" around the British constitution and ""handed the detonator"" to Brussels.","In the Mail on Sunday, the former foreign secretary said the Chequers deal was ""feeble"" and ""pathetic"". He has been strongly criticised by some Tories - one minister said it marked a ""disgusting moment"" in politics. And Home Secretary Sajid Javid called for ""measured language"" to be used. Writing in the same paper, the current Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called for people to rally behind Mrs May, backing her to hold the line ""in the face of intense pressure"". The UK is leaving the EU on 29 March 2019, and the government's plan - agreed at Chequers in July - has sparked criticism from Brexiteer Tories as well as the EU. In his article, Mr Johnson accused the EU of ""bullying"" the UK - but questioned why the response had been ""so utterly feeble"". He said that rather than getting a ""generous free trade deal"", Britain is saying, ""yes sir, no sir, three bags full sir"", to Brussels. ""At every stage of the talks so far, Brussels gets what Brussels wants,"" wrote Mr Johnson. ""It is a humiliation. We look like a seven-stone weakling being comically bent out of shape by a 500lb gorilla."" He said the reason for the UK's response was the ""insanity of the so-called backstop"" - the commitment by the UK and the EU to come up with a solution to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. However, his call to scrap the proposed backstop has been heavily criticised by Sinn Féin and the SDLP. Sinn Fein said Mr Johnson's comments were ""foolish and dangerous"", while the SDLP said he had ""absolutely no regard for people on this island"". The BBC's political correspondent Alex Forsyth said the ""scathing remarks"" by Mr Johnson showed his ""willingness to challenge the prime minister remains undimmed"" after recent revelations about his private life. It is Mr Johnson's second attack on the prime minister's Brexit strategy inside a week, as last Monday he said the Chequers deal ""means disaster"" for Britain - Downing Street responded to that attack by saying he had offered ""no new ideas"". 'Hurtful analogy' While Mr Javid voiced measured criticism of Mr Johnson, other Tories reacted more angrily to his remarks. Former Army officer and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Tom Tugendhat graphically described the aftermath of a suicide bomb that had gone off near his office in Helmand province, Afghanistan. He said comparing such an attack to the PM's plans ""isn't funny"", adding: ""Some need to grow up"". Foreign Office Minister Sir Alan Duncan criticised his former boss, saying the article was ""one of the most disgusting moments in modern British politics."" If this latest broadside was not the end of Mr Johnson's political career, ""I will make sure it is later"", he said. Another Foreign Office minister, Alistair Burt, tweeted: ""I'm stunned at the nature of this attack. There is no justification for such an outrageous, inappropriate and hurtful analogy. ""If we don't stop this extraordinary use of language over Brexit, our country might never heal. Again, I say, enough."" But backbench Tory MP Nadine Dorries defended Mr Johnson in the face of what she was ""vitriol"", saying his critics were ""terrified of his popular appeal"". And Tory Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen said the way Mr Johnson ""says it how he sees it and speaks truth unto power"" was ""something that endears him to a huge swathe of the British public"". On the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Javid said: ""I think there are much better ways to articulate your differences. I think it's a reminder for all of us in public policy, whichever political party we represent, to use measured language because I think that's what the public want to see."" He backed the Chequers proposals which he said represented ""the only deal that we've got on the table"". In his Mail on Sunday article, Mr Hunt said Parliament would get to debate and vote on any agreement, adding: ""Until then, we should not rush to judgement on a deal that is still under negotiation."" Johnson 'dossier' It is the first public comment from Mr Johnson since he and his wife, Marina Wheeler, confirmed they were getting divorced earlier this week. The announcement followed newspaper allegations the former London mayor had been having an extra-marital affair. The Sunday Times has reported that Mrs May's aides wrote a 4,000-word ""dirty dossier"" on Mr Johnson in 2016, exposing a ""catalogue of lurid allegations"" against him. The paper says it has seen the document - said to have been written during the Conservative leadership contest - but officials at Downing Street and Conservative Campaign Headquarters have denied circulating it. No-deal 'disorder' claim Elsewhere the National Police Chiefs' Council said there was no intelligence to suggest there would be an increase in crime or disorder if the UK and the EU cannot agree a deal. NPCC operations lead Chief Constable Charlie Hall was responding to a Sunday Times report of a leaked document about police contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit. According to the paper, the document warned that concerns around medical supplies could ""feed civil disorder"", and that potential goods shortages raised concerns of ""widespread protest which could then escalate into disorder"". It also warned that the ""necessity to call on military assistance is a real possibility"" in the weeks after UK's departure from the EU. Mr Javid said he did not expect a no-deal outcome, adding: ""I'm glad the police and other experts are looking into this and thinking what might happen in a no-deal scenario.""","the Mail fyfyfyon Sunday, the former foreign secretary said the Chequers deal was ""feeble"" and ""pathetic"".

world-europe-20514194,France to back Palestinian bid for UN status,France has confirmed it intends to vote for Palestinian non-member status at the United Nations later this week.,"Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said France had long backed Palestinian ambitions for statehood and would vote yes ""out of a concern for coherency"". The Palestinians are asking the UN General Assembly to upgrade their status from permanent observer to a ""non-member observer state"". Israel and the US oppose the move, due to be voted on later this week. They are concerned that the Palestinians are trying to seek full statehood via the UN, rather than through negotiation as set out in the 1993 Oslo peace accords under which the Palestinian Authority was established. Washington has warned that it could hinder rather than help future dialogue. Britain 'undecided' ""You know that for years and years France's consistent position has been the recognition of the Palestinian state,"" Laurent Fabius told the lower house of parliament. ""That is why when the question is raised on Thursday and Friday, France will respond with a 'yes'."" Backing international recognition of a Palestinian state was a campaign pledge made by Francois Hollande before he became France's president earlier this year. It was a policy first set out by Francois Mitterand in 1982, and has been pursued by Mr Hollande's predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy. However, Mr Fabius cautioned that the vote came at a delicate time - with a recent ""extremely fragile"" ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, looming Israeli elections and a new administration of re-elected US President Barack Obama. ""It's only with negotiations between the two sides that we demand immediately, without any preconditions, that a Palestinian state can become a reality,"" he said. France - a permanent member of the UN Security Council - is the first major European country to come out in favour of the move. Germany is expected to vote against, while the UK's ambassador to the UN, Mark Lyall Grant, said on Tuesday that London remained undecided. According to AFP news agency, Mr Lyall Grant told reporters the UK thought the Palestinians should delay the application, but was still in talks with the Palestinian Authority and would decide ""in due time"" how to vote. Austria says it will also back the Palestinian bid and claims that more than half of the European Union's 27 member states will vote for the proposal, AFP reports. Observers say the application is likely win approval in the 193-member UN General Assembly, as it needs only a simple majority to pass. According to the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), more than 130 countries already grant the Palestinians the rank of a sovereign state. 'Unilateral steps' An upgrade in status would allow the Palestinians to participate in General Assembly debates and improve their chances of joining UN agencies and the International Criminal Court (ICC), although the process would be neither automatic nor guaranteed. If they are allowed to sign the ICC's founding treaty, the Rome Statute, the Palestinians hope to take legal action in the court to challenge Israel's occupation of the West Bank. The bid follows a failed attempt in 2011 by Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority and chairman of the PLO, to join the UN as a full member state. The proposal failed because of a lack of support in the Security Council. As well as seeking to become a non-member observer state, the latest Palestinian resolution also calls for a Middle East settlement that ""fulfils the vision of two states, an independent, sovereign, democratic, contiguous and viable state of Palestine, living side-by-side in peace and security with Israel, on the basis of the pre-1967 borders."" Israel opposes any pull-back to the 1967 lines. Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Lior Ben Dor told the BBC earlier this month that President Abbas would be in breach of the Oslo peace accords if he continued to press for UN recognition. And he warned that if the Palestinians sought to ask the ICC to resolve disputes with Israel, then Israel would ""take unilateral steps to protect its interests"". He did not elaborate on what those measures would be, but reports in the Israeli media suggested they might include halting the transfer of tax revenue to the Palestinian Authority and restricting the movement of Palestinian officials through the West Bank. President Abbas has said he does not ""want any confrontations with the United States or Israel"", adding: ""If we can start a dialogue or negotiations the day after the [UN] vote, we will."" The Palestinians have long sought to establish an independent, sovereign state in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. However, two decades of on-and-off peace talks have failed. The latest round of negotiations broke down in late 2010 over the issue of Jewish settlement building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Attempts to restart direct talks have failed.","before he became France's president earlier this year.

uk-wales-39231826,How Bristol's major trauma centre works,"Wales is to get its first major trauma centre, which will have a specialist medical team on call 24 hours a day for the most serious emergencies.","Across the Severn Bridge, Bristol has operated one of two major trauma centres (MTC) for the south west of England since 2012 - along with Derriford in Plymouth. It is estimated survival rates have improved by 30%. It started at the old Frenchay hospital before moving to the new £430m Southmead super-hospital four miles away in 2014. A cluster of six other hospitals - including Bristol Royal Infirmary - operate as major trauma units in a network around it. But Southmead, one of 27 MTCs across England, is in line to take the most critical cases first - involving up to 1,500 patients a year. Dr Ben Walton, consultant in intensive care medicine, said it offered a consistency of service which was not possible before. ""The feeling when these centres were first set up in London it would take five years to see improvements - we've seen it in 18 months,"" he said. ""In the past, if a patient was seriously injured in a road traffic collision or fell at home, they'd be taken to the nearest hospital with an emergency unit. ""Now, if they fulfil certain criteria and the assessment of the ambulance or pre-hospital doctor crew is that they're likely to have a serious injury, they will by-pass their nearest emergency department and be transferred directly to the major trauma centre."" Dr Walton said the major trauma centre could gather together multiple specialists around the clock and deal with injuries which are often complex. ""Patients are met by a trauma team which is 24/7, 365 days of the year and there will always be a senior clinician - a consultant - leading that team. ""That's of benefit to patients and can't be provided at every hospital, it's impossible."" There is a flow of patients between the other trauma units and the MTC, depending on the seriousness of their condition and stage of their care. But Dr Walton said: ""I think there's no doubt the rehabilitation of patients in our network is patchy. There's not a joined up, consistent service."" Major trauma also went beyond road crashes ""people falling or being shot or stabbed"". He added: ""A significant proportion are elderly patients with complex, pre-existing medical needs who have had what you might see as an innocuous fall or injury.""","cross the Severn Bridge, Bristol has operated one of two major trauma centres (MTC) for the south west of England since 2012 - along with Derriford in Plymouth.

uk-england-bristol-22261107,Car-free Sundays in Bristol to start in June,"Car-free Sundays in Bristol's city centre will start in June, the mayor has announced.","George Ferguson said the idea was not about ""closing roads but opening them to people"" and said he hoped to see ""entrepreneurial activity"". The scheme was originally due to run weekly but will run once a month due to operating costs of £195,000. Baldwin Street, King Street and all roads in the Old City will be closed during car-free Sundays. Mr Ferguson said five days were planned this summer, with the first on 23 June. The £195,000 cost covers all five days. 'Suck it and see' He said he had been inspired by similar schemes in Bordeaux in France and Bogota in Colombia. ""I'm very keen on taking a 'suck it and see' approach and this is why we're starting on a monthly basis - if it's a success we'll move it into a weekly basis,"" Mr Ferguson said. ""I want people to feel their way and see how they to respond to it. ""It will have some costs in the early stages while we set it up, but in time I hope it becomes a natural thing with a very low cost."" He added the money would pay for marshalling the road closures and also to provide some of the entertainment. Blue badge spaces People will still be able to drive in to the city as there will be routes to the main car parks, Mr Ferguson said. He also said there would also be provision for disabled drivers and public transport would be largely unaffected. ""I don't think you can close it [the city centre] off completely but I think we can make a large amount of it pedestrian or certainly mixed use,"" Mr Ferguson said. Nick Licata who owns the Brigstow Cafe on Clare Street said he preferred the monthly plan to the original weekly idea.

uk-england-47318094,Birmingham pub bombings: Jury sworn in for inquests,"A brother and sister whose father was among the victims of the Birmingham pub bombings say they are hoping for ""the truth"" from the resumed inquests.","Two bombs ripped through the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs on 21 November 1974, killing 21 and injuring 220. A jury was sworn in earlier as the inquests reopened after a long fight by families. Paul Anthony Bridgewater and Michelle Sealey are among relatives attending. Mr Bridgewater, whose father Paul Anthony Davies died in the bombings, said: ""The coroner has ruled out a lot of things but we want the truth really. ""We want the truth and we want to know what happened back then. It's been too long and there's that many theories out there and unanswered questions as well."" Coroner Sir Peter Thornton said the jury of six women and five men had an ""important civic duty"" as he adjourned the inquests until Tuesday. The individual inquests could last up to six weeks, the coroner said. The jury will return verdicts on how all victims died. The hearings began with a minute's silence. Sir Peter said the inquests would not deal with the issue of who planted the bombs, adding that was a ""task of police, prosecutors and the criminal courts"". He said although a single hearing, lasting up to six weeks, the inquests would deal with ""21 separate people, 21 separate lives lost from two terrible events"". Jurors, sitting at Birmingham Civil Justice Centre, were told they would hear evidence from only a few eyewitnesses because some were ""no longer alive"". Sir Peter added: ""They will be doing their best to recollect events accurately, but we all know memory will sometimes have gaps."" He said there would be details of the so-called ""forewarning issue"", and evidence the British authorities may have received information signalling the attacks, including an alleged tip-off concerning a ""possible conversation in a local prison nearly two weeks before"". Jurors would also hear an account of ""evidence of a students' visit to a police station the evening of the bombings, which was cancelled"", Sir Peter said. Mr Bridgewater said the loved ones of victims had formed close bonds. He said: ""We are a like a close-knit family and that's what bonds us and keeps us strong."" His sister Ms Sealey added: ""It's the knockbacks that make you want to push forward even more because there is something there that we need to find out."" Inquests were opened days after the bombings but adjourned because the case was subject to a criminal investigation. The Birmingham Six were jailed for the murders and served 17 years behind bars before their convictions were quashed. Despite the subsequent overturning of the verdicts, the inquests were never reopened. Fresh inquests were ordered in 2016 but delayed because victims' families disagreed with the coroner, who ruled out naming those suspected of carrying out the bombings. But the Court of Appeal in September upheld the coroner's decision. George Jones, who lost his father John Clifford Jones, told the BBC he hoped the remit of the inquests would have been broader. ""It's an opportunity to answer a lot of questions but my own feelings and those of most of us is those avenues have been cut off by the coroner's decision of narrowing the scope,"" he said. Paul Bodman, whose father Stanley died, described the hearings as ""a tick-box exercise"". ""It's a stepping stone to see what we can get from this inquest and perhaps we can take it further,"" he said. Hearings will continue on Tuesday and Wednesday with pen portraits of each of the victims, while on Thursday, the jurors will be taken to the former sites of the pubs. Sir Peter is due to give his closing address on 28 March before the jury's deliberations start the next day. Analysis By Midlands correspondent Sima Kotecha Today marks a significant moment in this long running story. These attacks on Birmingham happened more than four decades ago - and still the families of those killed have many unanswered questions. Some of them have fought with every ounce of their energy to have the inquests into the bombings reopened to try and establish some of the detail that has been missing. Today, the coroner will begin that process of attempting to fill some of the gaps - but will it be enough? Already the scope of the inquests has been narrowed - and the crucial perpetrator issue will not be addressed so the families will not discover who was behind the killings. So what will they learn over these weeks - and will it add anything new to what they already know, even though it may not be in the public domain? The answer to the latter will assess the effectiveness of the process in their eyes. However, for the coroner and the courts, much sought after inquests taking place in the first place is likely to be viewed as a triumph.

The five-vehicle collision took place on the A141 near Wyton, Cambridgeshire, in June 2014, Peterborough Crown Court heard. Mother-of-two Mrs Garrett joined Cambridgeshire Police in 1991. Helen Guest, for the prosecution, said Mr Warby, of School Road, Runcton Holme, was driving the 13.6-tonne light goods vehicle along the A141 in Cambridgeshire when he opened a text message on his phone. The court heard his vehicle crossed the white line in the centre of the road and clipped an oncoming lorry, showering two cars in debris, before crashing into a Renault Clio which was also in the oncoming line of traffic. The Clio was driven by Mrs Garrett, who was on her way home from work. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Ms Guest said Mr Warby had opened a text message on his phone one minute and six seconds before the crash. She said: ""If you're interacting with a mobile phone, your eyes aren't on the road and your two hands aren't on the steering wheel."" Ms Guest told the court conditions at the time of the crash were good and vehicle defects were not a factor. She said Mr Warby's lorry was travelling at 53mph (85km/h) on a stretch of single carriageway restricted to 40mph (64km/h) for lorries at the time of the collision. Ms Guest said Mr Warby had been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnoea in late 2015 and his defence lawyers would argue he experienced a micro-sleep just before the crash. The prosecution's case is that Mr Warby's reaction to apply the brakes after the first collision was ""rapid"", and not consistent with a person who had been asleep.

uk-politics-56823344,Leo Docherty: Minister pledges 'protection' for Troubles veterans,"The new veterans minister has pledged legislation ""soon"" to protect British troops who served during the Troubles from unfounded prosecutions.","Leo Docherty, who took up the role on Wednesday, said ministers would give ex-soldiers who served in Northern Ireland the ""protection"" they deserved. His predecessor in the role, Johnny Mercer, quit on Tuesday in protest at their treatment by the government. He was unhappy at their exclusion from a bill debated by MPs on Wednesday. The government says the Overseas Operations Bill will protect soldiers from ""vexatious claims"" for alleged historical offences in conflicts overseas. Mr Mercer said he had been ""forced"" to resign because the government had failed to deliver on promises for a similar law covering Northern Ireland. He said the government had ""abandoned people in a way I simply cannot reconcile"" in allowing ""endless investigations"" into historic killings to continue. On Wednesday, the PM's official spokesman said details of the new legislation would be announced ""in the coming weeks"". ""There is more to be done on the issue of the Northern Ireland legacy and we are committed to making progress on this as quickly as possible,"" he added. ""We are engaging with Northern Ireland parties and the community in Northern Ireland, including victims' groups as well as the Irish government, on the way forward."" Armed Forces Minister James Heappey told the BBC on Wednesday the conflict in Northern Ireland ""needs to be dealt with separately"". ""It was an internal UK counter terrorism operation, not an overseas war like Afghanistan or Iraq, so it was always going to require its own piece of legislation,"" he added. Six former soldiers who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles are currently facing prosecution. In 2019, the Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland said of 32 ""legacy cases"" it had ruled on since 2012, 17 related to republicans, eight to loyalists, and five were connected to the Army. Plans were announced last year by the government to restrict the number of Troubles killings which could be fully investigated under a new approach where ""new, compelling evidence"" would be required. But the Overseas Operations Bill would go further for other veterans, such as those who served in Iraq or Afghanistan, by proposing a five-year limit on criminal prosecutions. Ministers have already been forced into a climbdown over the scope of a proposed ""presumption against prosecution"" after this time frame. Human rights groups, former military commanders and lawyers had criticised plans in the original version of the bill for this to include torture, genocide and crimes against humanity. On Tuesday, the government announced it would accept demands from the House of Lords for the these offences to be excluded from legal safeguards. It tabled an amendment on the issue designed to replace one from Labour's Lord Roberts backed by peers earlier this month - which MPs then approved on Wednesday. Speaking ahead of the vote, Mr Docherty told MPs that ""not explicitly excluding these offences from the bill is clearly an omission that must be rectified"". He said the government had agreed to change the bill after listening to the ""very real concerns"" from MPs and peers that the bill would damage the reputation of the UK government and the armed forces internationally.","xῶeo Docherty, who took up the role on Wednesday, said ministers would give ex-soldiers who served in Northern Ireland the ""protection"" they deserved"
uk-england-london-33966632,Battle of Britain: Flypast for 75th anniversary of 'Hardest Day',"Aircraft including 18 Spitfires and six Hurricanes have flown over south-east England to mark 75 years since the Battle of Britain's ""Hardest Day"".","The event recalled 18 August 1940, when Bromley's Biggin Hill and other South East military bases came under attack from the German Luftwaffe. It became known as the ""hardest day"" as both sides recorded their greatest loss of aircraft during the battle. The Battle of Britain lasted throughout the summer of 1940. It was the first major campaign fought entirely in the air. BBC reporter Clark Ainsworth at Biggin Hill What a sight. Watching those iconic World War Two aircraft take to the skies above Biggin Hill was something to behold. Spectators gasped as they then circled the airfield in formation. The roar of the Merlin engines and the grace with which the Hurricane and especially the Spitfires, climb, bank, dive and weave through the air is a joy to behold. All the aircraft have now landed with spectators invited to see them up close and take pictures. And although they are beautiful to look at on the ground, it is in the sky where they truly shine. The Hardest Day commemorations in pictures The Luftwaffe flew 850 sorties, involving 2,200 aircrew, while the RAF resisted with 927 sorties, involving 600 aircrew. The RAF and German Air Force lost 136 aircraft in one day. The special commemoration, staged from the former RAF airfield at Biggin Hill, now a commercial airport, honours the pilots, engineers, armourers, operations staff and ground crews who faced attack that day. BBC iWonder - Why do we love the Spitfire? More than 3,000 spectators went to Biggin Hill to see the aircraft including squadron leader Tony Pickering who flew on the ""Hardest Day"". He said: ""I don't think I was ever afraid. You've got to make sure you don't get too enthusiastic. You couldn't take on the German air force by yourself. ""It's lovely to see these aircraft. Beautifully designed aircraft and there's no doubt about it. The people who made them... they did a good job."" Will Curtis, managing director of Biggin Hill Airport, said it was remarkable that the Spitfire was ""still a joy to fly"", adding that ""real credit"" goes to its designer RJ Mitchell. He said: ""It is as finely tuned and as well-balanced, if not better balanced, than a modern aircraft."" The day was marked with three flight formations, which took off from the airport at 13:00 BST: On 10 July, aircraft including Hurricanes and Typhoons took part in a flypast over Buckingham Palace as part of the 75th anniversary.","event recalled 18 August 1940, when Bromley's Biggin Hill and other South East military bases came under attack from the German Luftwaffe.

technology-21322183,"Google searches expose racial bias, says study of names","A study of Google searches has found ""significant discrimination"" in advert results depending on the perceived race of names searched for.","Harvard professor Latanya Sweeney said names typically associated with black people were more likely to produce ads related to criminal activity. In her paper, Prof Sweeney suggested that Google searches may expose ""racial bias in society"". Google has said it ""does not conduct any racial profiling"". In a statement to the BBC, the company said: ""We also have an 'anti' and violence policy which states that we will not allow ads that advocate against an organisation, person or group of people."" When placing ads with Google, companies are able to specify which keywords they would like to target. ""It is up to individual advertisers to decide which keywords they want to choose to trigger their ads,"" the search giant said. Arrested? The study analysed the type of advertisements that appeared on Google when certain names were searched for. It looked at Google.com's core search engine, as well as the search function of Reuters.com - which also displays Google's advertising. Prof Sweeney's investigation suggests that names linked with black people - as defined by a previous study into racial discrimination in the workplace - were 25% more likely to have results that prompted the searcher to click on a link to search criminal record history. She found that names like Leroy, Kareem and Keisha would yield advertisements that read ""Arrested?"", with a link to a website which could perform criminal record checks. Searches for names such as Brad, Luke and Katie would not - instead more likely to offer websites that can provide general contact details. ""There is discrimination in the delivery of these ads,"" concluded Prof Sweeney, adding that there was a less than 1% chance that the findings could be based on chance. ""Alongside news stories about high school athletes and children can be ads bearing the child's name and suggesting arrest. This seems concerning on many levels."" User habits However, she was reluctant to pinpoint a cause for the discrepancies, saying that to do so required ""further information about the inner workings of Google AdSense"". She noted that one possible cause may be Google's ""smart"" algorithms - technology which automatically adapts advertising placement based on mass-user habits. In other words, it may be that the search engines are reflecting society's own prejudices - as the advertising results Google serves up are often based on the most popular links previous users have clicked on. ""Over time, as people tend to click one version of ad text over others, the weights change,"" Prof Sweeney explained. ""So the ad text getting the most clicks eventually displays more frequently."" She argued that technology should be used to counteract this effect. ""In the broader picture, technology can do more to thwart discriminatory effects and harmonise with societal norms.

uk-england-london-19798173,Mark Duggan death: Kevin Hutchinson-Foster 'lied about gun',"A man on trial for supplying a gun to Mark Duggan the day the 29-year-old was shot by police said he tried to ""distance"" himself from the shooting.","Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, 30, said he ""lied"" to police about handling the gun in the week before the shooting for fear of being thought of as a ""snitch"". He denies giving Mr Duggan an illegal handgun on 4 August last year. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard he had borrowed a gun for a day, but returned it a week before Mr Duggan was shot. Mr Duggan's death sparked riots in Tottenham, which led to disorder in a number of English cities and towns. Mr Hutchinson-Foster denies selling or transferring a prohibited firearm to Mr Duggan between 28 July and 5 August 2011. Barber 'pistol-whipped' Giving evidence, he said he lied to police when they asked him whether he had handled the gun in the week before Mr Duggan's death because he did not want anyone to think ""I had something to do with Mark dying"". He had used the gun to pistol-whip a barber in a hair salon in Hackney on 29 July and the blood of both men was found on the weapon, the court heard. He said he borrowed the gun ""for show"" in the confrontation with the barber, but returned it later that day. Mr Hutchinson-Foster also said he lied when he told police Mr Duggan had been part of a group of men that beat him with a gun a week earlier. Prosecutor Edward Brown QC, suggested this was an ""invented attack"" to account for the fact that his blood was found on the handgun which police found after Mr Duggan was shot. The barrister said: ""You have tried to fit your lies through the evidence as it developed."" To which Mr Hutchinson-Foster replied: ""The event did happen."" He said he had been in touch with Mr Duggan for weeks over a drugs deal, several of which took place in the hours leading up to Mr Duggan's shooting by police. 'Agitated and angry' The defendant said Mr Duggan wanted to come to Leyton to supply drugs, but in a later phone call on the way to Leyton, the defendant told the court Mr Duggan wanted him to accompany him to Tottenham to collect the drugs. But Mr Hutchinson-Foster said he could not because he had to take another girlfriend to a dance audition, and Mr Duggan went alone. Mr Hutchinson-Foster said after Mr Duggan was shot he received a phone call from a mutual friend, Mo, who was also involved in the drug deal. The defendant said: ""He was very agitated and angry at me and basically said I snitched up Mark."" As news of the shooting spread, he said he received a number of calls accusing him of being a snitch and he switched phones the day after the shooting. He said he had lied to police in an effort to ""distance"" himself from any association with events that led to the shooting of Mr Duggan. The prosecution also alleges the defendant handed Mr Duggan the gun in a shoebox, 12 to 15 minutes before he was shot and that the box bore the fingerprints of Mr Duggan, Mr Hutchinson-Foster and his girlfriend Desire Cox. Asking him about the shoebox, Mr Brand said: ""So was it just a coincidence that a person fitting your description hands over a box ending up with your fingerprints on it, with Desire Cox's fingerprints on it and Mark Duggan's?""

A recent EU report criticised the police in Turkey for using excessive force during mass protests in June. But the EU Commissioner for Enlargement, Stefan Fuele, said such events only underlined the importance of Turkey's engagement with Brussels. A spokesman for the Turkish government called the latest talks a ""real turning-point"" in relations. Turkey signed an association agreement with the EU (then the European Economic Community) back in 1963. Over the years negotiations have stalled over a range of issues, including concern over freedom of speech and democracy, treatment of religious minorities, judicial reform, and ongoing tensions with Cyprus, an existing EU member. Some EU politicians worry that such a large, mainly Muslim country would change the whole character of the EU, while others point to the young labour force that Turkey could provide for an ageing Europe. 'EU benchmark' Tuesday's talks in Brussels focused on one of 35 policy areas, or chapters, in which candidate-states must meet EU standards in order to join the 28-member bloc. Chapter 22 deals with regional policy and covers job creation, competitiveness, innovation, economic growth, improved quality of life and sustainable development. Linas Linkevicius, foreign minister of Lithuania which currently chairs the EU, announced that ""further progress in the accession process"" had been made. ""We also welcome important progress on reforms that have been recently made in Turkey, in particular positive developments in the area of democracy and rule of law,"" he said. Mr Fuele said the EU must remain ""the benchmark for reform in Turkey"". ""We need more engagement, not less,"" he said.

uk-48394001,Students 'may have been unfairly deported' over English test cheat claims,"Foreign students may have been unfairly deported from the UK after being falsely accused of cheating in English language tests, a report has warned.","The government withdrew 30,000 visas from non-EU citizens after it emerged students were having other people sit their tests for them. The National Audit Office concluded cheating had been ""large scale"", but innocent people may have been deported. Thousands accused of cheating had since won leave to remain, it also said. The Home Office said the NAO's report highlighted ""the scale and organised nature of the abuse"", adding that 25 people had received criminal convictions for their role in the scandal. In 2014, BBC Panorama broadcast footage showing organised cheating in two English language test centres run by third parties for the non-profit organisation Educational Testing Service (ETS). The service used voice recognition technology to try to find out who had cheated by having someone else sit their test. ETS classified 97% of UK tests taken between 2011 and 2014 as suspicious, 58% as invalid, and 39% as questionable. In the wake of the findings, the Home Office shut down colleges, excluded students and cancelled visas. The head of the NAO, Sir Amyas Morse, said the Home Office ""should have taken an equally vigorous approach to protecting those who did not cheat but who were still caught up in the process, however small a proportion they might be"". ""This did not happen,"" he added. The watchdog said it could not estimate accurately how many innocent people may have been wrongly identified as cheats. As of March, 11,000 people who had taken the English tests had left the country after an accusation was made against them, the NAO said. One student accused in 2014, who did not want to use his real name, told the BBC's Today programme the Home Office tried to deport him in 2017 and kept him in a detention centre for seven days. ""All this actually made my life really miserable, I cannot even finish my studies,"" he said. At the beginning of May he launched an appeal to clear his name. He is waiting to hear the result. Last month, a woman who came to the UK from Bangladesh in 2010 told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she also had at one stage been detained after being accused of cheating. Fatema Chowdhury, who finished her law degree at the University of London in 2014, denied the allegation and said no evidence of her alleged cheating had been presented to her. She is not currently being threatened with removal from the UK, but while remaining in the country cannot work or use the NHS for free.

""When you don't have anything to occupy your mind it goes into kind of a spiral, and that's when trouble starts,"" he says. Preparations for the trip have taken more than six years, but Mr Lecomte has been targeting the challenge for much longer. In 1998, he made the first known solo trans-Atlantic swim covering 6,400km (4,000 miles) in 73 days. When he finally reached dry land in France, his first words were ""never again"", but he was soon looking for a new challenge. ""It didn't take that long for me to change my mind,"" he told NPR.

The NEC Group is being sold because the council faces a £1.1bn bill. The council said it ""could not confirm"" whether Genting is its preferred buyer for the group, which also includes the National Exhibition Centre, the International Convention Centre and the National Indoor Arena. 'Shopping and entertainment' Birmingham City Council had originally hoped the sale would be completed by the end of 2014 but said an announcement was now expected this year. It faces a bill for a backlog in pay settlements which have been agreed with thousands of employees who, over many years, were paid less by the city council than colleagues - mainly men - who did equivalent jobs. Genting, a Malaysian-based casino and leisure group, said sponsorship of the arena ""will provide an opportunity to build the awareness of the Genting brand across the UK"". It is also developing a £150m shopping and entertainment complex adjacent to the arena site named Resorts World Birmingham.

world-asia-42178873,What North Korean Hwasong-15 missile launch pictures tell us,North Korea has released pictures and videos of its controversial launch of a new missile which it claims can hit anywhere in the mainland United States.,"The images feature North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and several high-ranking military officials celebrating as the Hwasong-15 takes off. This is what we have learnt. The rocket is enormous Many observers have been struck by the missile's vast size - this undated picture released by state media of Mr Kim dwarfed by the rocket he is inspecting gives an idea of its scale. Michael Duitsman, a research associate at the Centre for Nonproliferation Studies, noted that the missile was much bigger than its previous iteration the Hwasong-14, and added: ""Only a few countries can produce missiles of this size, and North Korea just joined the club."" Some have also noted that the rocket appears to have more sophisticated steering and thrusters. The ""new, more capable missile"" seems to have a more powerful propulsion system with two main engines and looks like it can carry more than twice as much propellant, David Wright of the Union of Concerned Scientists told Reuters news agency. It also has a larger and blunter nose cone, which could mean it can carry a ""super-large heavy"" nuclear warhead on its tip, as Pyongyang claims. All this means that the missile appears capable of transporting a nuclear warhead for a long distance and possibly surviving atmospheric re-entry. North Korea claims that the Hwasong-15 is a viable intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). There is a new transporter Photos and videos also appeared to show the missile launching from a platform, and not from a mobile launcher which North Korea has used in previous missile tests. A large nine-axle vehicle transported the rocket to the site. Analysts believe this arrangement was due to the missile's large size, and means it needs more time to launch. In a situation when snap responses need to be made, ""this makes a big difference during crises,"" said NK Pro analyst Scott LaFoy. The launch took place against a striking backdrop of a night sky filled with stars, with a noticeable but perhaps unsurprising absence of light pollution. It was celebrated with cigarettes A jubilant Mr Kim is seen in many of the pictures, grinning as the rocket takes off. The missile's steep trajectory can be seen on screens in the background, apparently charted in real time. It is believed to be North Korea's highest-ever missile, and Pyongyang said it achieved a height of 4,475km (2,780 miles). Mr Kim and his coterie appeared to waste no time in celebrating the successful launch - with cigarettes. It is not known how far away the viewing platform was from the launch site, but Mr Kim may have form in smoking in the vicinity of fuel-laden missiles - some believe this video from July shows him puffing on a cigarette right next to a Hwasong-14.",", and North Korea just joined the club.""

He was suspended on full pay in 2013 amid allegations of misconduct, but the charges were dropped before trial. Council leader David Poole said the ongoing issue was ""hugely frustrating"". Mr O'Sullivan was suspended, along with his deputy Nigel Barnett and the head of legal services Daniel Perkins, after the Wales Audit Office declared their pay rises were unlawful. It had been claimed they had agreed to give themselves a 20% increase when most other council staff faced pay freezes. Criminal charges against the three men were dropped in 2015, and Mr Barnett and Mr Perkins left their jobs in October last year with compensation payouts between them of nearly £300,000. But Mr O'Sullivan has yet to reach agreement with the council and remains on special leave. The head of the investigation estimated the matter would not be resolved until March at the earliest, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Mr Poole said: ""It's disappointing and hugely frustrating that we are being asked to provide further funding to allow this investigation to reach a conclusion. ""We are facing significant cuts over the next few years and none of us want to see our shrinking budgets being diverted away from frontline services."" He said the council was ""bound by a statutory process which is completely outside of our control and it is absolutely essential that we fully comply with relevant employee legislation"". The additional funds will cover the costs of the continued investigation and Mr O'Sullivan's salary until the end of July. Colin Mann, leader of the council's Plaid Cymru group, said the figures were ""staggering"". ""This is public money that could have been spent on frontline services,"" he said.

Two other ceasefires agreed earlier this month over the conflict were broken almost immediately. Fighting erupted on 27 September around the mountainous enclave. The conflict has intensified again in recent days. The ""humanitarian ceasefire"" was announced on Sunday in a joint statement released by the US, Armenian and Azerbaijani governments. It came into effect at 08:00 local time (04:00 GMT) on Monday. The announcement followed discussions between US Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun, Armenian Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan and his Azerbaijani counterpart Jeyhun Bayramov. The US state department said agreement was reached following intense negotiations. US President Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday to congratulate those involved. However, within minutes of the ceasefire coming into effect, Azerbaijan accused Armenian forces of shelling the town of Terter and nearby villages in ""gross violation"" of the agreement. Armenia's defence ministry said Azerbaijani artillery had fired on military positions in various parts of the front line after the ceasefire agreement had begun. In a post on Facebook, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan insisted his country ""continues to strictly adhere to the ceasefire regime"". Hikmet Hajiyev, a spokesman for the Azerbaijani president, said Armenia was trying to ""preserve the status quo based on occupation"", adding: ""The Azerbaijani side is exercising restraint."" Refugees watch and hope as fighting rages At the scene: Olga Ivshina, BBC News, Barda, Azerbaijan Schools in the town of Barda are crowded but there are no lessons here. Schoolchildren are staying home because of the coronavirus outbreak and their classrooms are now occupied by refugees from the Terter region of Azerbaijan. Shelling there hasn't stopped since the first day of the fighting. Ostagamed Isfandyarov, now living in the school with his family, proudly shows me his grandson's drawings of a Kalashnikov assault rifle, a machine gun and a rocket propelled grenade. ""Look at how precise the details are,"" he says. In the pictures tanks and helicopters shoot at each other. These young boys are yet another generation growing up thinking war is just a part of life. And these are not the first families to have left everything behind. Thousands of Azerbaijani refugees from the first Karabakh war are still living in state-funded dormitories. Conditions are pretty basic but for these refugees there is only one problem with where they have been living for the past 30 years - it isn't home. When I arrived I found them glued to the TV waiting for news about the villages and towns being taken by the Azerbaijani army. Finally, they tell me, this could be our chance to go home. Mediators from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) are also due to meet again on Thursday to discuss the conflict. Two earlier ceasefires brokered by Russia have failed to hold. The president of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, has also warned Russia not to get involved militarily in the conflict. Nagorno-Karabakh is recognised internationally as part of Azerbaijan but is under ethnic Armenian control. Clashes that began in the region in September quickly escalated into a large-scale conflict, with the shelling of towns and cities and the alleged use of banned cluster munitions.

world-latin-america-50587028,Colombians turn out in memory of dead protester Dilan Cruz,"Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets of the Colombian capital, Bogotá, in memory of a teenage protester who died on Monday.","Dilan Cruz was hit by a projectile fired by riot police during an anti-government protest on Saturday. His death has caused outrage and further fanned anger at the government of President Iván Duque. The president has been meeting protest leaders this week to attempt to put an end to the disruption. Many of the protesters denounced the Esmad, the riot police squad which fired the projectile which hit Mr Cruz. Others said the Colombian state was ""a killer"" because of what happened to the 18-year-old student. The protests started a week ago when trade unions and student groups convened a march attended by a quarter of a million people. Their demands are wide-ranging and include calls for the government to drop a proposed tax reform and a thorough implementation of the peace agreement signed with left-wing Farc rebels in 2016. Since the death of Mr Cruz, protesters have added the demand for the dissolution of the riot police force Esmad to their demands. The protest was not confined to the capital. There were also marches in Cali and other Colombian cities. Many of those taking part in rallies on Wednesday were young people demanding better access to education and employment. ""I'm marching so we 21 year olds can have the chance of a good job,"" Jean Carlo Hernandez told Reuters news agency. ""Dilan could have been me. We're facing a government that doesn't want to help young people move ahead even though we're the future,"" he added. The marches of Wednesday were largely peaceful with members of the conservatory of music of the National University taking part playing their instruments while aerial artists and breakdancers also joined in.

uk-politics-24901566,"Openness needed on Whitehall deals, says watchdog","Ministers must ensure openness over the performance of private contractors or face a ""crisis of confidence"", the National Audit Office has warned.","Firms such as Serco, Capita, G4S and Atos were being paid hundreds of millions of pounds each year, it said. But the spending watchdog called for more punishments - such as fines and exclusions from future contracts - where ""problems"" were reported. The government said it was working to create better value for money. The National Audit Office (NAO) has published two reports looking at major public service contracts. It said Serco's were worth £1.8bn, including £611m with the Ministry of Defence and £382m with local government. Capita's totalled £1.08bn, while those for G4S and Atos were £718m and £683m respectively. 'Political fallout' The NAO said the Cabinet Office, which oversees much of central government, often lacked ""commercial experience and expertise below senior levels"", and information on its 40 strategic suppliers was ""inconsistent and incomplete"". The public sector profit margins for Serco appeared to be between 0% and 9%, between 1% and 10% for Capita, and between 3% and 22% for Atos. G4S made an overall loss on some of its public sector contracts last year, giving an overall return ranging from -8% to 16%. The reports mentioned continuing investigations into issues with contractors, including the Ministry of Justice looking at the way G4S and Serco had billed it for electronic tag monitoring. The NAO said: ""Transparency is needed to ensure that no-one within the contractor can hide problems and that it is in the contractors' commercial interest to focus on their client's (the government's) needs."" Companies would ""likely concentrate on maintaining shareholder value"", it said, adding: ""Government needs to ensure that it is in the contractors' financial interests to focus their control environment more widely on meeting the standards expected of public service. ""This involves using contractual entitlements to information, audit and inspection to ensure standards are being met. ""And it is likely to involve financial penalties, banning from competitions and political fallout when problems are found."" 'High-profile failures' NAO head Amyas Morse said there was ""a crisis of confidence at present, caused by some worrying examples of contractors not appearing to treat the public sector fairly, and of departments themselves not being on top of things."" He added: ""While some government departments have been admirably quick off the mark and transparent in investigating problems, there is a clear need to reset the ground rules for both contractors and their departmental customers."" The Institute for Government's director of research Tom Gash said: ""The current pace and scale of outsourcing outstrips the ability of Whitehall officials to design and manage complex contracts effectively. ""Government should therefore phase changes when outsourcing services for the first time and avoiding contracts that lock taxpayers into service models that can quickly become outdated when policies, technologies or provider capabilities change. ""Without a more transparent and measured approach to outsourcing, high-profile failures are likely to multiply."" But a Cabinet Office spokesman said: ""Last year alone we saved taxpayers £3.8bn from our commercial reforms, including renegotiating contracts with our largest suppliers, and we welcome the NAO's recognition of our achievements. ""Since the general election we have made it easier for smaller businesses to work with Whitehall and many more are winning contracts."" He added: ""We know that the civil service lacks commercial capability and that contract management needs to be improved.

uk-politics-12657524,David Cameron says enterprise is only hope for growth,"With no money left in the government coffers, the ""only strategy"" for growth is to get behind Britain's entrepreneurs, David Cameron has said.","By Brian WheelerPolitical reporter, BBC News In a speech to his party's spring conference, the PM declared war on the ""enemies of enterprise"" - and said he was on the side of ""go-getters"". And he vowed 23 March's Budget would be the ""most pro-growth this country has seen for a generation"". But Labour accused Mr Cameron of ""warm words but no action"". Chancellor George Osborne has already told the Tory conference in Cardiff that his Budget will be ""unashamedly pro-growth"" and will include 10 new enterprise zones to boost some of the most deprived areas of England. 'Spark of initiative' Mr Cameron used his speech to reinforce his pro-growth message, and to promise a ""fundamental rebalancing of our economy"" with ""less debt, more saving; less borrowing, more investment; less dependence on financial services, more new industries, exports and trade"". With interest rates at a record low, and no money to spare, the prime minister said he wanted to champion the growth and ingenuity of the British people. He said: ""The spark of initiative. The courage to make your dream happen. The hard work to see it through. ""There's only one strategy for growth we can have now and that is rolling up our sleeves and doing everything possible to make it easier for businesses to grow, to invest, to take people on. ""Back small firms. Boost enterprise. Be on the side of everyone in this country who wants to create jobs, and wealth and opportunity."" 'Social good' On a practical level, Mr Cameron promised to open up government procurement processes to more small businesses. ""I can announce today that we are taking on the enemies of enterprise. ""The bureaucrats in government departments who concoct those ridiculous rules and regulations that make life impossible for small firms. ""The town hall officials who take forever to make those planning decisions that can be make or break for a business - and the investment and jobs that go with it. ""The public sector procurement managers who think that the answer to everything is a big contract with a big business and who shut out millions of Britain's small and medium sized companies from a massive potential market."" 'Reckless plan' Mr Cameron said ""enterprise is not just about markets - it's about morals too"", adding: ""We understand that enterprise is not just an economic good, it's a social good."" And he said the Conservatives had always been a ""party of builders and businesswomen; electricians and engineers; roofers and retailers"". ""At its beating heart this is still a party of start-ups, go-getters, risk-takers. ""What drives us is getting things done - and what drives us mad is the bureaucracy, the forms, the nonsense getting in our way."" It was speech that focused almost exclusively on domestic issues, but he did touch on Libya and repeated his call for Colonel Gaddafi to ""go"". He also urged Conservative activists to vote against changing the voting system in the referendum on 5 May. 'Reheated rhetoric' Labour has accused the Conservatives of lacking a strategy for growth and being more interested in grabbing headlines. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: ""When we urgently need a plan for jobs and growth to get the economy moving again and help hard-pressed families all David Cameron and George Osborne can offer is empty words but precious little action.

However, it acknowledges the early results are not conclusive. One expert told the BBC the data used had a significant limitation because it was unlikely to have included box-set streaming. Spotting trends The study made use of data from the London Internet Exchange (Linx), which connects internet service providers and content delivery networks. It operates exchanges in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Manchester, but some of the data was extrapolated from the London area alone. Andrew Ferguson from the news website ThinkBroadband told the BBC that while the study had merit, often online box-set viewing will not be included in Linx data as this is delivered in a different way. ""This is not the full story but when combined with other data can reveal trends, rather than absolute figures,"" he said. While the ONS said it was still working on the statistics, it found that internet traffic in the UK increases in winter and decreases in summer. Other insights included that traffic: The ONS made comparisons with other data such as road traffic information - for example, matching an increase in traffic on the M25 motorway around London during the time that internet data traffic was lower, as people commuted home after work. This approach also revealed some interesting behaviours around special events: there was not a significant spike in data flow during online shopping sale cyber- Monday, and during the England v Croatia football World Cup semi-final in 2018 there was more data exchanged during half time and before the extra time at the end of the match than there was during game itself.

Ospreys rugby players and Swansea City footballers are among the 100 people who also volunteered to help. Swansea East MP Carolyn Harris said she was ""overwhelmed"" by the donations. Food and essential items have been donated in the hampers, which will be sent across the area, while Swansea council and bus companies have donated vans and buses to help deliveries. Ex-Swansea City forward Lee Trundle will be handing out signed shirts on the doorsteps, while ex-Wales centre James Hook is signing copies of his children's book for some of the hampers, which are being packed in Swansea's Mecca Bingo.

uk-england-bristol-48842088,Centuries-old building found in Bristol mansion grounds,The remains of a building dating back 400 years have been uncovered during an archaeological dig in the grounds of a mansion house.,"Archaeologists decided to excavate the front lawn at Ashton Court mansion in Bristol after parch marks appeared during the dry summer last year. ""Well-preserved substantial walls"" which have been uncovered are thought to be an old stable block depicted on historical maps and engravings. The dig continues until 18 July. Lead archaeologist Tony Roberts said: ""The walls uncovered so far are some of the best preserved that I have witnessed in a number of years excavating."" He said an ""older, hitherto unknown building"" could be beneath the ground. Mr Roberts said a geophysical survey indicated there were a lot more walls and rooms under the front lawn than just those of the old wing that housed the 18th Century stables. The walls that have been uncovered are about 1.5 ft (0.5m) high, with the floor levels yet to be reached. The excavation is being conducted by archaeologists Archeoscan.

10418681,Newquay pins hope on alcohol rules for exam teenagers,New rules introduced in the Cornish resort of Newquay after the deaths of two teenagers in 2009 face their first real test.,"By Jonathan MorrisBBC News, Plymouth Over the next few weeks thousands of teenagers are expected to make their annual pilgrimage to Newquay, intending to celebrate after exams. For Tracy Earnshaw, who lives a stone's thrown from pubs and bars in the town, their fun has been her nightmare. ""It's quite demoralising knowing we are going to get night after night of broken sleep. ""We will get wing mirrors ripped off cars, cars will get keyed, they will run over the bonnets and roofs of cars."" Door kicked in She said years of rowdiness had been ""destroying"" for and her family. ""It's petty crime, but it just goes on and on. ""I've had my front door kicked in, a brick thrown through my window and I've been flashed at. ""You do wonder what it'll be next."" Newquay has been known as a party venue for years, with about 30 bars and clubs in the town centre. But the deaths of teenagers Paddy Higgins and Andrew Curwell in the space of nine days last summer led to some sober thinking. Both had fallen from cliffs after going to Newquay to celebrate the end of exams. Paddy had reportedly been served sambuca liqueur in a restaurant before his death. But how to curb the antics of thousands of teenagers hell-bent on having a good time? After a demonstration by local people calling for change, police, the local authority, pub and club owners and campsites came up with Newquay Safe. Youth workers at campsites are on hand to offer advice to teenagers who are transported to and from the town by a special bus service so they can attend venues which offer alcohol-free events. Licensed premises have also agreed not to sell alcohol to anyone who looks under 18 without a passport or driving licence. Police will be welcoming teenagers arriving in the town with sniffer-dog searches and any alcohol found on under-age people will be confiscated. Councillors from the area have also been talking to pupils at schools around the country, urging them to ""be responsible and be safe"". But Guy Thomas, Newquay town centre manager, said parents should not be expect the authorities to be chaperones. ""I had an email from a parent last week who had heard on the grapevine that if they sent their 15-year-old daughter to Newquay we would provide an independent policeman for the duration of their visit. ""Clearly that is not something we are going to be doing."" And he said the changes were no guarantee against another death. ""We will never be able to legislate for personal choice or for people who decide to go off and do something completely stupid. ""We can only handle that as it happens, but there are much more stringent measures in place this year. ""Ultimately, the strength we have is we're all working together."" In a test of the new measures nearly four weeks ago, two 15-year-old Bristol girls were sent home from Newquay after being found drunk and unaccompanied. The town is still relatively quiet at the moment, so the real test will come at the height of the holiday season when the town's population of 20,000 swells to 120,000. Paddy Higgins's father, John, said: ""We will only know if they've worked after the season and the years after. ""We have just got to hope they are going to be enough.

uk-scotland-highlands-islands-50464091,Captivity-bred wildcats to be released into wild in Cairngorms,Critically-endangered Scottish wildcats bred in captivity are to be released into the wild for the first time.,"By Kevin KeaneBBC Scotland's environment correspondent Funding has been secured for a six-year project to breed and release up to 60 animals beginning in 2022. Experts have predicted it is ""highly likely"" the species - known as the Highland tiger - will become extinct without the intervention. EU funding worth £3.2m has been secured to develop a reintroduction centre in the Highland Wildlife Park at Kincraig. The cats will be raised away from public view to minimise interaction with humans before their release. Potential release sites are being explored within the Cairngorms National Park. The project is being led by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland which runs the wildlife park. Helen Senn, head of conservation, said: ""Wildcats are on the brink of extinction in Scotland but it's not too late. ""Using wildcats from the existing captive population, as well as cats from Europe to boost the gene pool, the reintroduction centre will provide a sustainable source of wildcats for years to come."" The Scottish wildcat is the only native member of the cat family still found in the wild in Britain. 'Functionally extinct' For the past few years, conservationists have been focusing on five ""priority areas"" in Scotland. Their main defence has been to trap, neuter, vaccinate and release feral cats in those regions to minimise harm to the wildcat populations. But a study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature declared Scottish wildcats to be ""functionally extinct"" because of hybridisation with feral or domestic cats. It examined DNA from hundreds of dead and living wildcats and found they were part of the same hybrid gene pool as domestic cats. But wildcats have been bred in captivity since the 1970s and they now have a stronger genetic link to their ancestors. To prevent further hybridisation, Martin Gaywood from Scottish Natural Heritage believes it is important cat owners neuter and vaccinate their pets. He added: ""Releasing species into the wild for conservation purposes is very complex and challenging. ""With the first wildcats expected to be released into the wild in 2022, now is the time for a public discussion on domestic and feral cat populations, and how we manage these, and the public will have an important role in helping minimise future hybridisation."" A breeding team at the wildlife park has managed to double the number of wildcats in captivity in the UK to 120 over the last five years. Four are on public display at Kincraig with a further nine living in large enclosures out of view to minimise human interaction. The rest are held in zoos and private collections across the UK. The project will use existing cats to breed another generation which will be the ones selected for release. Each will be fitted with a GPS collar which allows their movements to be monitored for about the first year of their lives.","beginning in 2022.

Martin Barkley, the trust's chief executive, said the hospital was struggling to recruit in a ""national shortage of midwives"". ""Nor is it fair to our staff to continue to stretch our midwifery resource so thinly"", he added. The trust would still offer midwifery-led facilities at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield and Dewsbury Hospital, it said. It would continue to run antenatal and postnatal clinics at Pontefract and the closure would be reviewed next autumn. 'Absolutely criminal' Ms Cooper, Labour MP for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford, said: ""It's an absolute disgrace that our midwife-led maternity unit is set to close for nearly a year due to a national shortage of midwives."" The MP said she had already been to see the Health Secretary Matt Hancock ""but he has completely failed to do anything about it"". The temporary reduction for stroke rehabilitation and other post-operative care was because of ""less pressure on the beds"" at Pontefract for these patients, said the trust.

Netflix said it added 1.69 million users during the period from March to June. The streaming video firm now has 50 million users in over 40 countries. Netflix has sought to upend the television industry by commissioning original content for its streaming-video platform and taking on established brands like HBO. Viewers have reacted positively to shows like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black. Last year, the company's original programming was nominated for 14 Emmy TV awards, winning three, and this year its programming garnered a record 31 nominations.

The CQC said there would also be a review of its regulation of the County Durham hospital between 2015 and 2019. Ten workers have been arrested. BBC Panorama's undercover filming appeared to show patients with learning difficulties being mocked, intimidated and restrained. The site had at least 100 visits by official agencies in the year before the abuse was discovered. The CQC said it has commissioned David Noble QSO to undertake an independent review into how it dealt with issues raised by Mr Stanley-Wilkinson. It has previously said his draft report raised no concerns about abusive practices. Opportunities 'missed' A second, wider, CQC investigation ""will include recommendations for how its regulation of similar services can be improved, in the context of a raised level of risk of abuse and harm"". Responding to the announcement, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he had been ""appalled"" by the abuse allegations and was ""determined to ensure lessons are learnt so this never happens again"".

uk-politics-20217901,Nadine Dorries suspended as Tory MP in I'm a Celebrity row,Nadine Dorries has been suspended by the Conservative Party over her decision to appear on ITV1's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here.,"The Mid-Bedfordshire MP has had the whip withdrawn, a party source said. Ms Dorries will be the first sitting MP to appear on the show, which could see her being away from her job in the Commons for up to a month. The chief whip will meet her when she returns from Australia, when she will be expected to explain herself. The Conservative Party is concerned about Ms Dorries' inability to do parliamentary and constituency business while she is taking part in the programme. Ms Dorries said she wanted to use her appearance on the reality show to raise awareness of issues she is interested in, such as reducing the time limit on abortions from 24 weeks to 20 weeks. 'Heated debates' ""I'm doing the show because 16 million people watch it. Rather than MPs talking to other MPs about issues in Parliament, I think MPs should be going to where people go,"" she told the Daily Mail. ""I'm not going in there to upset people, but I have opinions. There are certain causes that I'm interested in, one of which is '20 Weeks'. ""I will be talking about this issue around the campfire. I hope there will be some lively, heated debates."" But she has come in for criticism over her decision to enter the celebrity jungle, with Home Secretary Theresa May saying: ""Frankly, I think an MP's job is in their constituency and in the House of Commons."" Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston said Ms Dorries should resign, telling the BBC: ""I was horrified, frankly. I think it just makes her look ridiculous and it brings politics into disrepute."" Paul Duckett, chairman of the Mid-Bedforshire Conservative association, said members may consider sacking Ms Dorries over her appearance on the show, adding that he had only learned about Ms Dorries appearance when media arrived in the constituency on Tuesday morning. Mr Duckett said Ms Dorries was a hard-working MP but the appearance might ""detract from the gravitas"" of her role. Prime Minister David Cameron - who has publicly clashed with Ms Dorries in the past - earlier refused to be drawn into the row, saying: ""Nadine Dorries can speak for herself on this issue."" 'Z-list celebrity' Relations between No 10 and Ms Dorries, a former nurse, have been strained since the prime minister made a joke at her expense in the Commons, describing her as ""frustrated"". He subsequently apologised. Ms Dorries grabbed headlines by describing Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne as ""two arrogant posh boys"" who were out of touch with the real world. Former Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik, who took part in I'm a Celebrity in 2010 after losing his seat, told the BBC the Conservative leadership was ""out of touch with the zeitgeist of the nation"". He added: ""I'm outraged by the fact that it thinks she's been wrong to do something that can put politics in touch with the public."" But former Tory MP Louise Mensch, who recently resigned from the Commons for family reasons and who has had a well-publicised spat with Ms Dorries over her decision, tweeted: ""Nothing sadder than a politician, or ex-politician, on any of those shows."" Labour MP Steve McCabe said: ""David Cameron was too weak to stop Nadine Dorries appearing on a reality TV show. ""But even after dithering over what to do all day, by suspending her he's acted more quickly over an MP who called him an 'arrogant posh boy' than he ever did over a chief whip who swore at a police officer."" In February 2010, Ms Dorries took part in the Channel 4 documentary series Tower Block of Commons, in which MPs moved in with benefit claimants on a deprived council estate. George Galloway, the only other sitting MP to have taken part in a reality game show that took him away from the Commons, when he spent three weeks on Celebrity Big Brother in 2006, also faced criticism that he was neglecting his constituents.","瀲 Mid-Bedfn of assshire MP has had the whip withdrawn, a party source sa  .

uk-scotland-glasgow-west-20945002,Families hope exhumation will answer Moira Anderson mystery,Three families are hoping the exhumation of a burial plot in North Lanarkshire can lay to rest a 55-year-old mystery over a missing schoolgirl.,"Moira Anderson's relatives believe the 11-year-old was murdered and her body hidden at Old Monkland Cemetery. The family of Sinclair Upton, who was buried there in 1957, have consented to their plot being excavated. For relatives of Alexander Gartshore, the search may confirm whether the child rapist committed another heinous crime. Moira's tortured family have not known what happened to her since she left her family home in Coatbridge on 23 February 1957. The 11-year-old, who was five weeks short of her 12th birthday, was running an errand for her family to a nearby Co-op store when she vanished during a blizzard. She was last seen on board a bus driven by Gartshore, who was jailed later that year for raping a 17-year-old babysitter. Despite decades of appeals, the schoolgirl was never traced. The case remained cold until 1999, when child abuser James Gallogley named his former friend Gartshore as the murderer. Gallogley was said to have made the confession to another inmate while he was dying in Peterhead Prison. Father accused After Gartshore's death in 2006, his daughter Sandra Brown, a former friend of Moira, published a book in which she accused her late father of the schoolgirl's murder. She said she believed Gartshore had initially buried the child's body in a ditch but later moved it to an open grave at Old Monkland Cemetery. Mrs Brown, who later received an OBE for services to child protection and set up the Moira Anderson Foundation, believes her friend's body lies in the burial plot of Sinclair Upton, a former acquaintance of Gartshore. The paedophile is later said to have remarked that Mr Sinclair ""done him a favour"". In 2007, a radar scan of the burial plot found anomalies in the soil that would be consistent with another body being buried there. Mrs Brown and Moira's sister, Janet Hart, who lives in Australia, then launched a petition to get Mr Upton's grave exhumed. The case finally took a decisive turn in 2012 when Scotland's top law officer, Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland, told police to re-open it as a murder inquiry. In December last year, a sheriff granted a request from Moira's relatives to open the grave. With the exhumation now under way, the families of Mr Upton and Gartshore - and above all, that of Moira Anderson - will be hoping for answers.","being excavated.

uk-44307037,"What is contempt of court, and why is Tommy Robinson guilty of it?","Former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson has been sentenced to nine months in prison after being found guilty of ""contempt of court"". What does that mean?","By Clive ColemanLegal correspondent, BBC News What is contempt of court? Contempt of court laws exist to ensure people get fair trials. The idea is that juries must not be influenced by anything but the evidence they hear in court. The rules apply to everyone from journalists to people posting comments on social media, and even jurors. If someone interferes with a trial, the defendants can walk free and a new trial might have to be held. The maximum sentence for contempt of court is two years in prison, but it can also be punished with an unlimited fine. The law is set out in the 1981 Contempt of Court Act. Contempt includes publishing anything that creates a substantial risk of seriously prejudicing ""active"" criminal proceedings. Proceedings become ""active"" when a suspect is arrested. Someone could also be in contempt by actions including taking photographs or film, recording what is said in court or talking to a jury member about a case. Why was Tommy Robinson found guilty of contempt? Tommy Robinson, also known as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, committed contempt of court by broadcasting footage of defendants accused of sexual exploitation. The hour-long broadcast, outside Leeds Crown Court in May 2018, was seen by thousands of people. Lawyers for the Attorney General said reporting restrictions had been put in place. These postponed the publication of any details of the case until the end of a series of linked trials, involving 29 defendants. This was to stop the juries in those cases being influenced. They also said the manner in which Robinson filmed the defendants at court was a problem. The aggressive confrontation could have influenced those on bail not to co-operate with the trial. Judge Dame Victoria Sharp said when explaining the decision, that Mr Robinson encouraged ""vigilante action"" in his Facebook Live. She also said that the video could have ""seriously impeded"" justice over a sexual grooming gang's trial. Robinson was originally jailed for 13 months for the offence in May 2018. But the Court of Appeal said his case hadn't been handled fairly. Then, the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox - the government's top legal adviser - announced that new proceedings could be brought against him. What other famous cases have there been? In 2011, the Sun and the Daily Mail were found guilty of contempt for pictures they published during a murder trial. They had shown the defendant holding a gun, which risked prejudicing the jury. The following year, the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror were found guilty of contempt, following serial killer Levi Bellfield's conviction for the murder of schoolgirl Milly Dowler. Their articles were part of an ""avalanche"" of bad character information about Bellfield, the hearing was told. The Daily Mirror article detailed his violent treatment and sexual abuse of former partners, including Jo Collings. However, the jury still had to consider its verdict on an attempted abduction charge relating to another victim. The coverage was considered prejudicial and the jury had to be discharged, denying the victim and her family the chance of justice. Bellfield was already in jail for the murders of Amelie Delagrange and Marsha McDonnell and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy. Does it apply on social media? Yes, discussions about court cases still need to stay inside the jury room. In 2011, in the first case of its kind, juror Joanne Fraill was punished for contacting defendant Jamie Sewart via Facebook - causing a £6m drugs trial to collapse. Fraill was jailed for eight months for contempt for both contacting Sewart and searching online about the case. Sewart had already been cleared but other defendants were still on trial, so proceedings were compromised. Social media users have been warned about commenting on court proceedings, and breaching restrictions put in place. Actress Tina Malone, for example, was given a suspended prison sentence for breaching an injunction protecting the identity of Jon Venables - one of James Bulger's killers. She shared a Facebook message which was said to include an image and Venables' new name. What else counts as contempt of court? Intimidation: Juries must be able to give verdicts without being subject to abuse or intimidation. Carrying out research: In 2012, juror and university lecturer Theodora Dallas was jailed for six months for carrying out her own research about defendant Barry Medlock, who was on trial for causing grievous bodily harm. Taking or posting photos: In 2016, Damian Parker-Stokes was jailed for 15 months for taking photographs in court as his friend Ryan Sheppard was being jailed for murder. Parker-Stokes posted one image on Sheppard's Facebook page with the words: ""Respect g at least u had the balls to admit it ...""

The BBC said changing the law could lead to more people failing to pay. In 2012 about 155,000 were convicted and fined for not paying the £145.50 fee. In total 180,000 people were prosecuted for not paying their licence - which is needed to watch or record live broadcasts on any device - accounting for more than one in 10 criminal prosecutions that year.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has now told the Daily Telegraph ""serious work"" would be done on the proposal to make non-payment a civil offence and that it could ease the pressure on criminal courts. He said: ""The culture secretary and I both agree that this is a really interesting idea - particularly given the pressure on our courts system. ""Our departments will be doing some serious work on the proposal."" Ms Miller said: ""This is an interesting idea but timing is crucial and decriminalisation of the licence fee should be on the table during charter review, not separate to the process.'' The BBC's current Royal Charter, which expires in 2016, sets out how it should be funded, what it does and how it is managed. A spokesman for the culture secretary added: ""Maria will put decriminalisation of the licence fee on the table during charter review discussions, but to do it before makes no sense. ""She has made clear that the BBC needs to get its house in order, particularly when it comes to governance and transparency, having decriminalisation on the table during the negotiations will focus the BBC's minds."" But Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen is seeking to introduce the change through an amendment to the government's Deregulation Bill. It would make non-payment of the licence fee a civil matter, with a fine for offenders set by the government. He told the Daily Telegraph: ""It is outrageous that so many people are brought in to the criminal justice system through this means. ""I believe that non-payment should be treated in the way that parking tickets are. ""It is absurd that the courts are being clogged up by such a minor offence."" The newspaper reported that the amendment had been backed by 101 cross-party MPs. A BBC spokesman said: ""Legislation is a matter for the government, however changing the law could lead to higher evasion. ""Just a 1% increase in evasion would lead to the loss of around £35m, the equivalent of around 10 BBC local radio stations.""","גulture Secretary Maria Miller said ""decriminalisation of the licence fee should be on the table"" during the BBC's charter review before 2017.

Many victims were from the Hazara community, who are mainly Shia Muslims. The community has been frequently targeted by extremists from Pakistan's Sunni Muslim majority. Both the Pakistani Taliban and the Sunni militant group Islamic State (IS) said they had carried out the attack. Quetta, a city in Baluchistan province that is home to more than half a million Shia Hazara, has witnessed the majority of IS attacks in Pakistan.

Baluchistan Chief Minister Jam Kamal Khan Alyani condemned the attack, promising the ""best possible"" medical care for the injured, according to Pakistan news website Dawn. Those guilty were enemies of humanity, he said. Amnesty International's Deputy South Asia Director, Omar Waraich, condemned the attack, saying: ""This horrific loss of life is a painful reminder of the threats that Quetta's Hazara community continues to face.

It follows scenes of bodies of Greece-bound migrants, including a three-year-old boy, washed up on a Turkish beach.. Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said Northern Ireland ""could take a couple of thousand refugees"" at first. Justin Kouame works for the Northern Ireland Community of Refugees and Asylum Seekers (NICRAS), which currently has about 500 members. ""They come here every day, it's like a sanctuary for them. They will get advice and support,"" he said. ""This humanitarian crisis brings back memories. ""And you know if people come here it will put a lot of pressure on small organisations like NICRAS. We cannot prepare for it, we just have to wait and see what's going to happen next."" He said a lot would depend on the goodwill and generosity of local people. ""People taking boats, some of them don't even know how to swim, but they're risking their lives like we saw yesterday on TV, losing a member of your family or your child,"" he said. ""This is a drastic situation for someone to put themselves into."" Jeffrey Donaldson, DUP, said: """"We have a history in Northern Ireland... one thinks of the Vietnamese boat people or the people from Hong Kong who came and settled. When it comes to refugees, people fleeing religious persecution, we need to make a distinction between that and what are called economic migrants.

Belfast Lord Mayor Arder Carson, Sinn Féin, has called on everyone in the city to show support for people caught up in the refugee crisis engulfing Europe. He urged people to go to a vigil on Monday at the City Hall at 17:00 BST, which, he said, would ""underline the city's reputation for compassion and generosity and willingness to help others"". ""These are real people, it is a humanitarian tragedy, and the untold suffering that they are enduring in the 21st century is almost beyond belief,"" he said. ""We have consulted with the agencies working with the refugees and they have made it clear that it is too difficult logistically to send goods such as blankets, clothes and food, what is really required is money."" On Friday, children from a Londonderry school - St Oliver Plunkett Primary School - sold vegetables from the school garden to raise funds for Syrian refugees. David McNarry, UKIP, said it was important to ask how Northern Ireland would cope with an influx of refugees. ""Are we going to bring people in to give them shelter, heat and food? There is nobody who would say: 'I wouldn't do that',"" he said. ""But are we going to give them permanent residence? Where will the houses come from, where will the jobs come from and where will the school places be found eventually? How will that sit with people who, today, in my country, are looking for a job or they are waiting on a house and they are unable to get their child the school place that they want?""

world-42873633,Reality Check: Where are the world's nuclear weapons?,"The Pentagon has outlined how it wants to revamp the US nuclear arsenal, and develop new low-yield bombs, largely in response to the threat from Russia.","By Reality Check teamBBC News Reality Check looks into where the world's nuclear weapons are located and who owns them. While the global stockpile of nuclear weapons has shrunk significantly since the Cold War, there are hundreds of warheads that could be launched at short notice, and experts say every nuclear-armed nation is modernising its arsenal or has plans to do so. Countries keep most details of their nuclear weapons secret, but it is known that nine countries own the estimated more than 9,000 nuclear weapons that are in military service. These are either deployed - mounted on land or sea missiles and kept at air bases - or in storage. About 1800 are on high alert and could be fired with little warning. The US and Russia own the vast majority of the world's nuclear weapons. Including retired warheads waiting to be dismantled, the total is said to be almost 15,000, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). This is a marked decline since the 1980s when the figure peaked at around 70,000. Why only these countries? Since 1970, 190 countries including the US, Russia, UK, France and China have joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). India, Israel and Pakistan never signed the agreement and North Korea left in 2003. The NPT recognises five states having nuclear weapons - US, Russia, France, UK and China - all of which had tested nuclear weapons before the agreement came into effect. Under the agreement, these countries should not maintain an arsenal forever. The treaty prohibits non-recognised states from developing nuclear weapons. South Africa, and former Soviet Union countries Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine have all given up theirs. Are countries making progress on disarmament? The US, UK and Russia have all been reducing the size of their warhead inventories, Israel's and France's are said to be relatively unchanged and China, Pakistan, India and North Korea are believed to producing more, according to the Federation of American Scientists. But at the very least, experts say, every nuclear-armed state has plans in place to modernise its nuclear stockpile. Modernisation is contrary to the spirit of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, says Shannon Kile, head of Sipri's nuclear project. The UK is planning to replace its fleet of Vanguard nuclear armed submarines, which carries its Trident nuclear missiles. The overall size of its arsenal will be reduced to no more than 180 by the mid-2020s. The US may spend more than $1 trillion (£703bn) by the 2040s upgrading its nuclear capabilities. Some of America's warheads can be found around Europe in Belgium, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, and Turkey, which host around 150 warheads between them. North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test in September and the jury is still out on whether Kim Jong-un's nuclear programme is capable of attaching a warhead to a long-range missile. In recent months, North Korea has demonstrated it has increasingly advanced missiles, which are said to have brought the United States within range. Will there ever be a nuclear-free world? A few months into his presidency, Barack Obama told a crowd of thousands in Prague that under his watch, America would commit ""to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons"". It appeared as though the world edged closer in July 2017 when more than 100 countries endorsed a UN treaty to ban nuclear weapons altogether. So far dozens of countries have signed the legally binding instrument, the first agreement of its kind to explicitly ban nuclear weapons. However the nuclear-armed states boycotted the negotiations. The UK and US say they never intend to join the treaty because it undermines the NPT. Allied Nato countries also failed to acknowledge the new agreement.

health-46865204,"A bit of meat, a lot of veg - the flexitarian diet to feed 10bn","A diet has been developed that promises to save lives, feed 10 billion people and all without causing catastrophic damage to the planet.","By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Scientists have been trying to figure out how we are going to feed billions more people in the decades to come. Their answer - ""the planetary health diet"" - does not completely banish meat and dairy. But it is recommending we get most of our protein from nuts and legumes (such as beans and lentils) instead. Their diet needs an enormous shift in what we pile on to our plates and for us to turn to foods that we barely eat. What changes am I going to have to make? If you eat meat every day then this is the first biggie. For red meat you're looking at a burger a week or a large steak a month and that's your lot. You can still have a couple of portions of fish and the same of chicken a week, but plants are where the rest of your protein will need to come from. The researchers are recommending nuts and a good helping of legumes every day instead. There's also a major push on all fruit and veg, which should make up half of every plate of food we eat. Although there's a cull on ""starchy vegetables"" such as the humble potato or cassava which is widely eaten in Africa. So what is the diet in detail? If you served it all up this is what you would be allowed each day: The diet has room for 31g of sugar and about 50g worth of oils like olive oil. How do your food choices impact on the environment? Don't cry because you can't play with our interactive. Update your browser to have a go! How do your food choices impact on the environment? Your results are below Will it taste awful? Prof Walter Willet, one of the researchers who is based at Harvard, said no and that after a childhood on a farm eating three portions of red meat a day he was now pretty much in line with the planetary health diet. ""There's tremendous variety there,"" he said. ""You can take those foods and put them together in thousands of different ways. We're not talking about a deprivation diet here, it is healthy eating that is flexible and enjoyable."" Is this for real, or just a fantasy? This plan requires changes to diets in pretty much every corner of the world. Europe and North America need to cut back massively on red meat, East Asia needs to cut back on fish, Africa on starchy vegetables. ""Humanity has never attempted to change the food system at this scale and this speed,"" said Line Gordon, director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, at Stockholm University. ""Whether it's a fantasy or not, a fantasy doesn't have to be bad... it's time to dream of a good world,"" she says. Taxes on red meat are one of the many options the researchers say may be necessary to persuade us to switch diets. Who came up with this? A group of 37 scientists from around the world were brought together as part of the EAT-Lancet commission. They're a mix of experts from farming to climate change to nutrition. They took two years to come up with their findings which have been published in the Lancet. Why do we need a diet for 10 billion people? The world population reached seven billion in 2011 and it's now around 7.7 billion. That figure is expected to reach 10 billion around 2050 and will keep on climbing. Will it save lives? The researchers say the diet will prevent about 11 million people dying each year. That number is largely down to cutting diseases related to unhealthy diets such as heart attacks, strokes and some cancers. These are now the biggest killers in developed countries. How bad is farming for the planet? The use of land for growing food and forestry accounts for around a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. That's about the same as from electricity and heating, and substantially more than from all the trains, planes and automobiles on the planet. When you look more closely at the food sector's environmental impact, you can see that meat and dairy are the major factors. Worldwide, livestock accounts for between 14.5 and 18% of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. When it comes to other warming gases, agriculture is one of the leading contributors to both methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Agriculture is also a significant source of air pollution with ammonia from farms a major cause of fine particulate matter, which the World Health Organization (WHO) says is a threat to health worldwide. Similarly when it comes to water, agriculture and food productions are one of the biggest threats, consuming 70% of global freshwater sources for irrigation. So will this diet save the planet? The researchers' aim was to feed more people while: However, just changing diets is nowhere near enough. To make the numbers add up, also requires a halving of food waste and an increase in the amount of food produced on current farmland. Why isn't meat being banned? ""If we were just minimising greenhouse gases we'd say everyone be vegan,"" said Prof Willet. However, it was unclear whether a vegan diet was the healthiest option, he said. So what happens now? The EAT-Lancet Commission is going to take its findings to governments around the world and bodies such as the WHO to see if it can begin to change the way we eat. Follow James on Twitter",biggie.

uk-northern-ireland-41401080,Belfast-built Tucano touches down for RAF squadron tour,There was a warm welcome home for a pair of Tucano Mark I planes as they roared in over Aldergrove airbase in County Antrim.,"By Mervyn JessBBC News NI The Belfast-built aircraft made the journey to mark the centenary of the Royal Air Force's (RAF) 72 Squadron. Their visit also coincides with the 30th anniversary of the basic trainer's first roll-out at the Shorts factory. The stop is the last one on a centenary tour of airbases that have been home to 72 Squadron over the decades. Flight Lieutenant Chris Nash, who flew one of the Tucanos into Belfast, explained why it is painted in the Battle of Britain colours of the Spitfire, with Enniskillen written on the fuselage. ""It's to do with the way the Spitfires were financed for 72 Squadron during the Second World War,"" he said. ""A war fund was set up at that time and local communities raised money to help build a Spitfire, and that's why they got their name down the side of the aircraft."" The experienced jet pilot explained that he felt a sense of intimidation as a young pilot flying the Tucano, the RAF's basic training plane, for the first time. ""There's more power,"" he said. ""You sit in the front as a student with the staff officer behind you, whereas in previous aircraft it's side by side. ""You're wearing an oxygen mask, you're on an ejection seat and it all starts to feel far more military. ""It's quite challenging to fly but very rewarding once you get used to it and it will continue to be the RAF's basic trainer until 2019."" When the Tucano was first rolled out at Shorts in east Belfast to great fanfare in 1987, the future of thousands of jobs depended on it. But the launch day was not without controversy. Several hundred Shorts workers blocked a road outside the factory in protest at the presence of the then Northern Ireland secretary Tom King over the government's signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Sir Philip Foreman, the Shorts boss at the the time, was not impressed by those who took part in the protest, describing their actions as damaging. ""I'm sure what went on today will be seen around the world and it will certainly damage our business - it puts at risk 7,000 jobs,"" he said. ""But I don't think the people who did this sort of thing really understand the damage they are doing and I can't stress too strongly how irresponsible it is."" In spite of the concerns, the Tucano proved to be a success. The RAF ordered more than 100 of the aircraft, which were built in a joint venture with the Brazilian aerospace company Embraer. Former Shorts test pilot Paddy Crowther has his own memories of that time, particularly of one occasion when his engine cut out while flying over Rathlin Island. ""There is only one engine on the Tucano so it made for an interesting time - we had to divert to Machrihanish near the Mull of Kintyre,"" he explained. ""But apart from that it was very enjoyable to fly - even people like Prince William thought it was good. ""I spoke to his father Prince Charles about it at Hillsborough Castle once and they both thought the Tucano was excellent. ""Compared to other more sedate Shorts aircraft like the Skyvan, 330 and 360 passenger aeroplanes, the Tucano had a little more oomph to it."" Shorts has a history of successfully developing and building aircraft, both civil and military. including the World War Two Stirling bomber.

uk-politics-39499331,PM hints at help for diesel car owners over 'toxin tax',"Diesel car owners could get some help from the government if cities adopt new charges to tackle pollution, Theresa May has suggested.","An ultra low emission zone will come into force in London in April 2019, with a £24 a day fee for some drivers. A so-called ""toxin tax"" of up to £20 a day is also expected to be rolled out to several other UK cities. The government was forced to act by a High Court judge after losing a legal battle with lawyers ClientEarth. It came after the UK got a ""final warning"" on air quality from the European Commission. One road in Brixton, South London, hit its permitted annual pollution level in five days. Owners of diesel cars - who were encouraged by previous governments to buy them as they were thought to be more economical and less harmful in terms of carbon dioxide emissions - have expressed anger and confusion at the move. Former Labour Chancellor Gordon Brown introduced a lower vehicle tax for diesel cars in 2001 - but there has been increasing concern that they emit dangerous levels of nitrogen dioxide, which is thought to cause thousands of premature deaths in the UK. London Mayor Sadiq Khan announced on Tuesday that from April 2019 there would be a £12.50 charge - on top of the existing congestion charge - in central London for petrol cars that do not meet Euro 4 standards and diesel vehicles that do not meet Euro 6 standards. According to City Hall, this will hit most petrol cars more than 13 years old in 2019, and diesel cars more than four years old in 2019. In 2015, former Labour science minister Lord Drayson said Tony Blair's government made a mistake in promoting diesel cars because they were now ""killing people"". Motoring organisations have said diesel car drivers are being ""punished"" for following a previous government's policy. And Mrs May has now hinted there will be schemes to help drivers who were told that diesel vehicles were the right purchase. Speaking on her trip to Jordan and Saudi Arabia, she said: ""Decisions will be taken when we produce that [air quality] plan. ""But I'm very conscious of the fact that past governments have encouraged people to buy diesel cars and we need to take that into account when we look at what we do in the future."" She did not set out any specific plans, but there have been reports of a scrappage scheme that could pay people to get rid of their diesel vehicles.","잠 ultra low emission zone will come into force in London in April 2019, with a £24 a day fee for some drivers.

He had been asked by a German newspaper if the UK could become a ""tax haven"" by further lowering corporation tax. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said his comments sounded like ""a recipe for some kind of trade war with Europe"". Having so far refused to offer a ""running commentary"" on her plans, Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to spell out the most detail so far of her Brexit strategy in a speech on Tuesday. Reports have suggested she will signal pulling out of the EU single market and customs union, although Downing Street described this as ""speculation"". In an interview with the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag newspaper, Mr Hammond said he was ""optimistic"" a reciprocal deal on market access could be struck, and that he hoped the UK would ""remain in the mainstream of European economic and social thinking"". ""But if we are forced to be something different, then we will have to become something different,"" he said. ""If we have no access to the European market, if we are closed off, if Britain were to leave the European Union without an agreement on market access, then we could suffer from economic damage at least in the short-term. ""In this case, we could be forced to change our economic model and we will have to change our model to regain competitiveness. And you can be sure we will do whatever we have to do.

""It seems to me a recipe for some kind of trade war with Europe in the future. That really isn't a very sensible way forward."" Mr Corbyn also said Mrs May ""appears to be heading us in the direction of a sort of bargain basement economy"", adding: ""It seems to me an extremely risky strategy."" More like Singapore? by BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam According to Philip Hammond, Britain might be ""forced"" to change its economic model. To what? For some, the true advantage of leaving the EU would be to tear up the 'rules' and make Britain more like Singapore. Singapore abides by World Trade Organisation and ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) trade rules, but it's famed for its light touch regulation - especially when it comes to financial services - which some Brexiteers feel is the opposite of EU ""meddling"". But turning a large G7 economy with a robust social model into a city state might be difficult. It might involve the government handpicking which industries it thinks will be successes and rapidly neglecting existing sectors. Millions of people would need to get brand new qualifications while those with undesirable skills would become surplus to requirements. Massive infrastructure projects might be rushed through with minimal consultation. For a country with Britain's past and present, is that a possible future? Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it appeared Brexit would mean a ""low-tax, deregulated race to the bottom"", with workers' rights and environmental protections threatened. She wrote on Twitter: ""If that is the case, it raises a more fundamental question - not just are we in/out EU, but what kind of country do we want to be?"" In her speech on Tuesday, the prime minister is expected to call on the country to ""put an end to the division"" created by the EU referendum result. She will urge the UK to leave behind words such as ""Leaver and Remainer and all the accompanying insults and unite to make a success of Brexit and build a truly global Britain"". Several of Sunday's newspapers claim Mrs May will outline a ""hard Brexit"" approach, a term used to imply prioritising migration controls over single market access. Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire said he did not think it was a ""binary choice"" between trade and migration, but added that the ""very stark message"" from the EU referendum was that ""free movement as it exists today cannot continue in to the future"". Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said a ""hard Brexit"" had not been on the ballot paper in June's referendum and accused the PM of adopting ""the Nigel Farage vision"" of Brexit.

This will be the first time pay and pensions are decided independently of Parliament or government. ""This is a huge change from the past,"" Sir Ian said. On the Ipsa website, he asks: ""How much should MPs be paid? ""I'm sure you have a view. We want to hear it."" Ipsa had dealt with the ""mess created by the expenses scandal"", Sir Ian said, with MPs' claims now documented online and rules adhered to. Deciding on MPs' pay and pensions was Ipsa's ""next big challenge"". Democratic heritage The body is hoping to reach a consensus on the experience and skills needed to be an MP, and what MPs' responsibilities are at work. This could help compare MPs' pay with that of similar roles. But it would not be easy, Sir Ian warned, since MPs argued that they all did their jobs differently and being an MP was a ""unique"" profession. Ipsa has decided ""to get as many views as possible"" before reaching any conclusions. ""Of course, the views must be informed rather than a reaction to recent events,"" Sir Ian said.

It is believed she suffered two cardiac arrests after the procedure to enlarge her breasts from a 70F to a 70G (UK: 34F to 34G).

Some students have been disciplined with ""internal exclusion"" for staging protests against the decision. Parent Mik Wells said the punishment was ""unfair and spiteful"". The school said the protests were ""truancy"". Principal Kate Mason announced the school would reintroduce a uniform in September following a report which suggested the school was perceived as ""scruffy"". She said the school hosted a consultation and the ""responses clearly favoured"" a uniform. 'Culture of fear' Pupils opposed to the changes staged protests - including waving banners and walking out of lessons - on 2, 3 and 4 July. But Mr Wells, whose 14-year-old daughter has been put into internal isolation for two days, said he was was ""shocked"" by the punishment. Chris Mockridge, whose daughter also goes to the school, said: ""This isn't all about uniform, there's people who really want the uniform who are really angry also. ""The communication within the school has completely broken down. ""They won't talk to me and they won't talk to anyone else - that's not a culture of openness, that's a culture of fear."" Police involvement Mr Mockridge said the exclusions were taking place during Activities Week. ""Parents have paid for these activities, the dearest of these is £250, and the kids are not going to go on those activities, so who's going to pay for them? No-one's talking."" On its website, the school said the protest had led to ""misbehaviour"". It said: ""The behaviour was disruptive but contained by staff on site and then by the police on the bridge. ""There was, however, a small number of students who chose to protest... such truancy cannot continue."" A police spokesman said no-one was arrested during the protest. The local education authority, Devon County Council, said it was a matter to be dealt with by school governors.

Patients, staff and management were interviewed. Ms Hinds will submit her report to the health minister shortly. Speaking to the BBC, she said there needed to be a better management of patients. When asked if some patients are being managed in an environment which is not safe, she said: ""There should be the appropriate number of nurses to look after the patients. ""When admitted to hospital and you are delayed in the system, someone should be appointed to care for you. ""There should be someone responsible for you, for monitoring you, and caring for you."" Ms Hinds refused to comment on the care of the elderly man who died on a hospital trolley at the Royal Victoria Hospital after waiting almost 24 hours for a bed. It was revealed last week that the man had died unnoticed in the accident and emergency department on Tuesday 6 March. However, Ms Hinds clearly laid out what should be in place when a person is admitted to an emergency department. ""It is our responsibility to try and fix it,"" she said. ""Even today I have challenged nurses to try and speak with courage to help fix their services every single day they go into work. ""For the very first time we've now got a commitment from the department to support normal ranges of staffing levels for nursing and that is a first. ""That will ensure safe staffing levels across our trusts in Northern Ireland. Speaking after a speech from Health Minister Edwin Poots to over a hundred nurses, where he outlined his plans to address the A&E crisis, Ms Hinds said he had shown ""great courage"". ""The Minister is showing real leadership,"" she said. ""He is showing that he's making it a priority, he is showing that patients being delayed in A&E is unacceptable.

It let someone hunting for bugs become the joint owner of hundreds of wallets. However, when the unidentified person tried to reverse their mistake they stopped the original owners of the wallets getting access too. Find and fix In a statement, Parity Technologies said all wallets created after 20 July this year were affected by the mistake. It provided a link to a separate page on which Ether holders could check to see if their wallet was among this vulnerable batch. Parity expressed regret over the ""great deal of stress and confusion"" the incident had caused. It added: ""We continue to investigate the situation and are exploring all possible implications and solutions."" It is not yet clear whether Parity will be able to rectify the mistake. This is because the unidentified person who triggered the problem used a function that ""suicided"" code that could have been used to resurrect the wallets. Estimates of exactly how much of Ethereum's coins has been frozen vary widely. Low estimates put the figure at $150m but others suggest it could be as high as $300m. The bug was triggered while an unnamed developer was looking through the Parity code for ways that it could be exploited. Only wallets created after 20 July are affected because they use an updated version of Parity's wallet program issued to fix another bug that led to $30m of Ethereum coins being stolen.

entertainment-arts-45395322,Chris Evans: A life in broadcasting,Chris Evans has announced he will be leaving the Radio 2 breakfast show at the end of the year to host Virgin Radio's equivalent.,"His departure will bring an end to the latest chapter in an eventful career that has brought him fame, riches - and some notoriety. Evans built his reputation as a witty prankster on London station GLR, where he started as a producer and ended up as a star DJ. He shot to fame in 1992 as host of The Big Breakfast, a riotous early morning programme on Channel 4. The Big Breakfast was a huge hit in its early days, beating even GMTV when it launched on ITV in 1993. The Warrington-born star's dynamic personality defined the show, which catapulted him from cult personality to national celebrity. Don't Forget Your Toothbrush, his first prime-time TV show, made its debut on Channel 4 in 1994. The format for the show - made by Ginger Productions, his own production outfit - was lucratively sold around the world. After leaving The Big Breakfast in 1994, Evans was recruited by BBC Radio 1 to revamp the station's breakfast show. He accepted on the proviso it would be in the hands of Ginger Productions, an arrangement the BBC was prepared to accept in return for bumper ratings. In 1996 he returned to Channel 4 to launch TFI Friday, a classic Evans cocktail of live music, celebrity chat, outlandish stunts and in-jokes. Yet he found it hard to juggle it with his Radio 1 day job, leading to a parting of the ways in January 1997 when his demands to work a four-day week were refused. ""I was stupid, no doubt about that,"" he admitted in 2009. ""I was ungrateful. I had this brilliant career and messed it up."" Evans was not off air for long. Later that year he returned to breakfast radio, on Sir Richard Branson's Virgin station. He liked the job so much he bought Virgin Radio from Sir Richard at the end of 1997. But the Evans magic started to fade soon afterwards. He was photographed out on the town with Paul Gascoigne, damaging the footballer's chances of getting into the England squad for the 1998 World Cup. TFI Friday started to go off the boil, while two BBC projects, the National Lottery-based Red Alert and student quiz Carry On Campus, flopped. That did not stop him selling his Ginger Media Group to the Scottish Media Group (SMG) for £225 million in early 2000. Yet things soon turned sour at Virgin. Evans failed to turn up for a week of breakfast shows and the station ignored his claim that he had been ill. Photographs and footage had emerged of him out drinking with pop star Billie Piper, prompting Virgin to dismiss him. Evans said the termination of his contract cost him £3 million in lost share pay-outs. Yet he ultimately lost his case against his former station. He and Piper married in 2001 and moved to Los Angeles. But their union did not last and they divorced in 2007. Evans would eventually return to the BBC in 2005 to present afternoon shows on Radio 2. After moving to Drivetime in 2006, he was named as Sir Terry Wogan's successor in the coveted breakfast slot in 2009. The following year he moved back to prime-time television by co-presenting BBC One's The One Show on Friday evenings. Evans went on to become one of the BBC's top earners, with figures last year revealing he brought in between £2.2m and £2.25m. This was partly due to him co-hosting BBC One's Top Gear following the departure of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May. Evans, a well-known petrolhead and experienced broadcaster, was seen as a safe bet to take over the helm of the BBC's flagship motoring show. Yet ratings plummeted, and the presenter was forced to apologise for an ill-advised stunt filmed around a monument to Britain's war dead. Evans left Top Gear after one series, concentrating instead on his Radio 2 show and his two children with third wife Natasha Shishmanian. One of the show's most popular initiatives is 500 Words, a story-writing competition for children now in its eighth year. Earlier this year Evans revealed that he and Natasha, a professional golfer and columnist, were expecting twins.

uk-wales-24073302,Archbishop of Wales hopes no one 'lost' over women bishops,"The Archbishop of Wales said he hoped no-one would be ""lost"" from the Church in Wales after its landmark decision to allow women bishops.","Dr Barry Morgan has pledged to talk to those Anglicans who ""find the decision difficult"". The Church's governing body voted overwhelmingly in favour of the change on Thursday. A similar vote in 2008 was narrowly defeated. In England, the issue is due to be discussed again in November. Despite female bishops being allowed in Northern Ireland and Scotland, none have been elected yet. The vote at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David in Lampeter, Ceredigion, led to huge cheers as the result was announced. But it has also led to some traditionalists saying the decision may lead them to consider their future within the Church. Canon Jenny Wigley, Rector of Radyr, whose successful amendment to the bill was instrumental in ensuring the vote had a yes or no outcome, said she hoped women in the Church of England would be encouraged by the result. ""Sisters across Offa's Dyke, look to us,"" she said. 'Promise' The vote leaves the bishops to write a code of practice for those who cannot ""accept the authority of women bishops"". Dr Morgan said: ""I hope it will be possible that no-one will be lost. It's a matter now for discussion. ""I promise on behalf of the bench of bishops that we will talk to a range of people across the Church. ""We'll come back in April to hear what people have to say but in the end the bishops will have to draw up the code of practice."" In the breakdown of the vote, the laity voted 57 for, 14 against, with two abstentions; the clergy section saw 37 voting for and 10 against, while the bishops voted unanimously in favour. Retired Father Alan Rabjohn, a traditionalist and chairman of Credo Cymru (Forward in Faith Wales), said: ""There is still a lot to be dealt with. 'Different world' ""The bishops said they would care for us. That sounds to me like 'we'll look after this lot until they die out'. ""We are not going away. We are here like our brothers and sisters who believe in women bishops,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. ""They have now got to really start talking to people. Not telling us what we need for terminal care but asking us what we need to go on living alongside our brothers and sisters and proclaiming the gospel. One of those who spoke against, Dr Elliott King, said he was still hopeful differences could be overcome.

uk-politics-55973463,"Covid: 'Clean up' awarding of contracts, says Labour","Labour has challenged the government to ""clean up"" how it awards contracts for Covid work.","In an online speech, shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said procurement during the pandemic had been ""rife with conflicts of interest"". And she called for a new ethics watchdog to ""guarantee standards"" for spending public money. The government said it has ""robust rules and processes"" to ensure that conflicts of interest do not occur. During her speech, Ms Reeves raised questions about contracts awarded to companies that she said have links to the Conservatives. She added that ""cronyism in contracting"" had led to ""unforgivable waste"" and showed the need for tougher transparency rules. It comes after a National Audit Office report last November found that more than half of contracts by the end of July 2020 had been awarded without competitive tender. As the pandemic struck last spring, there was a scramble to ensure that hospitals and other care settings had adequate supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE). The NAO found that companies recommended by MPs, peers and ministers' offices were given priority, and not enough was done to address potential conflicts of interest by ministers and other government officials. However, it concluded that in cases of potential conflicts of interest involving ministers, all had properly declared their interests and it found ""no evidence of their involvement in procurement decisions or contract management"". 'Very successful' The prime minister's press secretary Allegra Stratton said: ""We have robust rules in place to make sure there are no conflicts of interest. There are eight checks involved. It is rigorous."" She said procurement ""had to be done at speed, because in early stages of the pandemic we didn't have enough PPE inside the country. ""The government believes that the beginning of the pandemic we had to act very quickly and we were very successful at that."" She added that all public contracts would be published ""in the fullness of time"". 'Shadow state' During her speech, Ms Reeves also called on ministers to end emergency procurement rules brought in at the start of the pandemic, which have streamlined the normal bidding process for contracts. She said ""bad practices"" introduced at the start of the crisis had worsened, with contracts for protective equipment becoming an ""unseemly gold rush"". She urged ministers to publish ""all outstanding contracts"" by the end of the month, and for the Freedom of Information Act to cover all new public service contracts outsourced to private firms. She also criticised in the government's record in recovering money from firms that have failed to deliver services adequately or on time. ""The corporations running so many public services hide behind 'commercial sensitivity'. A shadow state has emerged and it is unaccountable to the people,"" she said.

Twenty-four staff are now self-isolating. The pub is one of a number in the city where either staff or customers have tested positive for coronavirus in the past few weeks.

uk-38182298,Child car seats: Will you be affected by rule changes?,New rules on child car seats are set to come into force after March next year and have left many parents confused about what they need to use.,"Changes are being made to the weight and height at which a child will be allowed to use a backless booster seat. However, parents will not need to replace car seats they have already bought because they can continue to use them. What is changing? From next year, changes are being made on the rules regarding backless booster seats. Currently, parents can use these types of seats for children who weigh 15kg (2st 5lbs) and above - typically aged three and over. The new rules will mean only children weighing over 22kg (3st 7lbs) who are also over 125cm (4ft 1ins) tall can use the seats. The United Nations, which sets the safety standards for car seats, has approved the change which must now be implemented by the EU. The government said the earliest the new rules will come in is March 2017 and they will affect the whole of the UK. Why bring in the new rules? Many child car seat experts say they are unsuitable for small children as the child is not held as securely in the seat, the adult seatbelt is not guided across their body in the best way and they offer little protection if a car is involved in a side-on crash. What if you have already bought one? Do not worry. The changes will only apply to new backless seats and not ones already on the market that meet current safety standards. Parents can continue to use their current model after the rule change and will not need to buy a new one. It will be down to manufacturers of new seats to ensure they meet the revised safety standards and are labelled correctly. What is the current law? Children must use a child car seat until they are 12 years old or 135cm (4ft 5in) tall, whichever comes first. There are typically three types of children's car seats: Only EU-approved child car seats can be used in the UK - which have a label showing a capital ""E"" in a circle. Parents should typically choose a car seat based on their child's height or weight. A driver can be fined up to £500 if a child under 14 does not wear a seat belt or child restraint. Anyone 14 and over not wearing a seat belt must pay the fine themselves. There are exceptions. For example, children can travel without a child car seat in a taxi or minicab if they travel on a rear seat and wear an adult seat belt if they are aged three or older or without a seat belt if they are under three. Which seat should you have? Many parents think they can judge which car seat they need to buy based on their child's age but it should only be used as guidance. Car seats are typically categorised according to height and weight. Height-based car seats, known as ""i-Size"" seats, must be rear-facing until the child is over 15 months old. For weight-based car seats, the type depends on how heavy a child is.

uk-england-leicestershire-42320938,Birstall house explosion: Woman dies in hospital,A woman has died following a gas explosion at a house in Leicestershire.,"Janet Jasper was taken to hospital following the blast, which happened on Allington Drive, Birstall, at about 07:30 GMT on Monday. Two men were also injured - one is in a stable condition in hospital and the other has been discharged. One house was destroyed, another torn in half and 50 others were damaged. A ""handful"" of families spent Monday night in temporary accommodation. An investigation is under way. Updates on this story and more from across the East Midlands The gas maintenance company Cadent, which supplied the collapsed house in Birstall, has confirmed it attended a call-out on Allington Drive on Sunday.

""I can't go through the details of that attendance because that's all part of the investigation but it's true that we attended."" The Shah family, who live next door to the demolished house, cannot return home because it is not structurally safe. Local people have offered them shelter, food and hot drinks. Tina Shah said: ""We have had lots of phone calls and messages. The whole community has been fantastic."" Talking about the explosion, she said: ""My son was in bed with me and our roof came in.

business-24494888,JP Morgan Chase reports quarterly loss on legal costs,JP Morgan Chase has reported a loss in the third quarter after setting aside $9.2bn (£5.8bn) to cover legal bills.,"The bank lost $380m during the quarter, compared with a profit of $5.7bn in the same period last year. JP Morgan is currently in talks with the US government over a potentially huge settlement relating to the sale of mortgage-related investment products in the run-up to the financial crisis. Last month, it paid $920m to settle charges related to a trading scandal. JP Morgan's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said: ""We continuously evaluate our legal reserves, but in this highly charged and unpredictable environment, with escalating demands and penalties from multiple government agencies, we thought it was prudent to significantly strengthen them."" He stressed that the bank's underlying business was strong. Stripping out one-off charges, the bank made $5.8bn over the three months to the end of September. Wells Fargo, the biggest US mortgage lender, also reported results on Friday. It reported a record net income of $5.3bn in the third quarter, up 13% on the same period in 2012. That rise came despite a fall in income at its mortgage business, where revenue fell 43% to $1.6bn. The fall was offset by lower expenses and a reduction in funds set aside for loans going bad. Legal trouble JP Morgan now has a contingency fund of $23bn to cover legal expenses. It also said that it could face litigation-related expenses of another $6.8bn. It is currently in talks with the Justice Department over a potentially huge settlement, related to the mis-selling of mortgage related products during the US housing boom. It is thought the settlement could cost as much as $11bn. Mr Dimon stressed on Friday that much of the case related to deals done by Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, companies that JP Morgan Chase bought during the financial crisis. ""The Board continues to seek a fair and reasonable settlement with the government on mortgage-related issues and one that recognises the extraordinary circumstances of the Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual transactions, which were undertaken at the request or encouragement of the US government,"" he said. Last month, JP Morgan paid $920m to settle a case related to disastrous trades by Bruno Iksil, who earned the nickname the ""London Whale"" for his big bets on the financial markets. Last year, the bank admitted to losses of $6.2bn resulting from his activities. As part of the settlement deal, JP Morgan admitted violating US federal securities laws.","bank lost $380m during th quarter, compared with a profit of $5.7bn in the same period last year.

world-middle-east-55949391,Israel's Netanyahu enters plea in court in corruption trial,Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied corruption charges in court for the first time as his trial resumes in Jerusalem.,"Mr Netanyahu entered his plea at the hearing which had been previously postponed because of the pandemic. He is the first serving Israeli prime minister to go on trial, which takes place just a month before elections. Mr Netanyahu, 71, is accused of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three separate cases. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the district courthouse ahead of the prime minister's brief appearance on Monday morning, making noise, waving banners and calling for him to resign. Mr Netanyahu had urged supporters not to come to court because of the threat of coronavirus. The prime minister arrived for the hearing wearing a black protective mask. Inside the courtroom he rose to reject the charges, before departing within 45 minutes while his lawyers continued deliberations. What is Benjamin Netanyahu accused of? Mr Netanyahu has been indicted in three cases, known as 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000: Mr Netanyahu has consistently denied all the charges against him, branding them a ""witch-hunt"" by political opponents, and has vowed to clear his name. How can the PM serve and stand trial at the same time? According to Israeli law, a leader charged with a crime is not required to resign. But there is no precedent. A former prime minister, Ehud Olmert, stepped down as party leader when he was under investigation for corruption in 2008 but technically remained prime minister until elections the following year - polls which brought Benjamin Netanyahu to power. What does the trial mean for the country? In short, a serving prime minister occupying the most powerful office in the land simultaneously trying to clear his name and avoid jail-time. It comes just six weeks before Israelis go to the polls in what is expected to be a close-fought election. While Mr Netanyahu's own Likud party has stood behind him, political opponents have tried to maximise the prime minister's legal difficulties, claiming he is unfit to hold office. Mr Netanyahu has though previously successfully fought three elections since criminal investigations into him began in 2016. Even if he is convicted and is still in power, Mr Netanyahu will not be required to resign unless and until any appeals are exhausted - which could, in theory, be many months or years into the future. In Ehud Olmert's case, the former prime minister went on trial in 2009 and after he was convicted only began serving his sentence in 2016 due to the long legal process.","been previously postponed because of the pandemic.
