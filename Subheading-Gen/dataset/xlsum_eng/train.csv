uk-england-birmingham-11726541,Birmingham Symphony Orchestra in 90th birthday event,A special birthday concert is taking place to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO).,"The event at the city's Symphony Hall will be held to mark the anniversary of Sir Edward Elgar conducting its inaugural Symphony concert. The CBSO will perform his Violin Concerto as part of Wednesday evening's event. The charity is core funded by Arts Council England and the city council. 'Next generation' The special concert will include Strauss's Suite from Der Rosenkavalier and Haydn's Symphony No. 90. Audience members have been invited to join the music director, Latvian Andris Nelsons, and the orchestra for a special birthday party. Mr Nelsons became music director in 2008, following in the footsteps of Adrian Boult, Louis Fremaux and Sir Simon Rattle. He will continue Birmingham's Mahler cycle with four performances of the composer's Symphony No. 5. Two will be held in the city on 23 and 24 November with two taking place in his home city of Riga on 26 and 27 November on the CBSO's first ever trip to Latvia. The orchestra, which had Symphony added to its name in 1948, held its first concert at Birmingham Town Hall and performed the majority of its concerts there from 1920 to 1991. The CBSO has five choruses, a youth orchestra and an education and outreach programme which ""reaches out to the next generation of music lovers"", it said. Birthday celebrations started with more than 30 concerts being held at schools in October. Wednesday evening's concert will be repeated on Thursday."

uk-37239256,Thousands of children reported over indecent images,"More than 2,000 children were reported to police in three years over indecent images, the NSPCC says.","The children's charity submitted a Freedom of Information request spanning 2013-15 to police across the UK. This showed 2,031 under-18s were reported for crimes linked to the possession, distribution, or production of indecent images of children. NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said children had to be educated about staying safe both offline and online. The law states that making or sharing indecent photographs of anyone aged under the age of 18 could be classed as an offence - but there have been calls for recording rules to be adapted so children are not routinely criminalised. The NSPCC sent the 45 police forces across the UK an FOI in May, and found the total offences of this nature recorded, regardless of age, were 4,530 in 2013, 6,303 in 2014, and 10,818 in 2015. Not all police forces provided age breakdowns, but for those which did, there were 11,697 investigations where the age of the defendant was recorded and 2,031 were under the age of 18. Image 'explosion' The charity also said that, of the 1,000 parents and carers from across the UK who took part in a recent online survey, only half of parents knew that children taking nude selfies were committing a crime. Mr Wanless said recent advances in digital technology has fuelled an ""explosion in the production and consumption of child sexual abuse images"" that increasingly involves live video streaming. He added: ""As well as pursuing and deterring adults who make and distribute these we must educate children about how to keep themselves safe online and offline and how to get help as soon as grooming or abuse happens. ""And every child who is the victim of exploitation and abuse should get the support they need to rebuild their lives."" And he said that the internet industry must prioritise this issue by working with the public and voluntary sector. In September, the BBC learned that a boy who sent a naked photograph of himself to a girl at school had the crime of making and distributing indecent images recorded against him by police. The boy, aged 14, who was not arrested or charged, could have his name stored on a police database for 10 years."
science-environment-40889934,Climate change has shifted the timing of European floods,"Climate change has had a significant impact on the timing of river floods across Europe over the past 50 years, according to a new study.","By Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent In some regions, such as southern England, floods are now occurring 15 days earlier than they did half a century ago. But the changes aren't uniform, with rivers around the North Sea seeing floods delayed by around eight days. The study has been published in the journal Science. Floods caused by rivers impact more people than any other natural hazard, and the estimated global damages run to over a $100bn a year. Researchers have long predicted that a warming world would have direct impacts on these events but until now the evidence has been hard to establish. Floods are affected by many different factors in addition to rainfall, such as the amount of moisture already in the soil and other questions such as changes in land-use that can speed up water run-off from hillsides. This new study looks at this issue in some depth, by creating a Europe-wide database of observations from 4,262 hydrometric stations in 38 countries, dating back to 1960. The analysis finds a clear but complex impact of climate change on river flooding. The most consistent changes are in north-eastern Europe around Scandinavia where earlier snow melt due to warmer temperatures is leading to earlier spring floods. Around 50% of monitoring stations are seeing floods eight days earlier than they did 50 years ago. The biggest changes are seen along the western edge of Europe, from Portugal up to Southern England. Half the stations recorded floods at least 15 days earlier than previously. A quarter of the stations saw flooding more than 36 days earlier than in 1960. In these regions, the issue isn't snow melt - it's more about saturated soils. Maximum rainfall tends to occur in the autumn and gets stored in the soils. Heavier and earlier rain means that the groundwater reaches capacity earlier. ""It's the interplay between extreme rainfall and the abundance of rainfall,"" lead author Prof Günter Blöschl, from the Technical University of Vienna, told BBC News. ""In southern England, it has been raining more, longer and more intensely than in the past. This has created a rising groundwater table and higher soil moisture than usual and combined with intense rainfall this produces earlier river floods."" However, around the North Sea, in the Netherlands, Denmark and Scotland, the trend is towards later floods. The scientists believe this is due to changes in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the weather phenomenon that pushes storms across the ocean into Europe. The NAO is driven by differences in atmospheric pressure between the North Pole and the Equator. Recent, rapid changes in temperatures in the Arctic are interfering with these pressure levels and changing the track of the oscillation and storms as well. According to this study, the storms are arriving later and as a result some river flooding happens later too. Prof Blöschl says that this study shows clear evidence of the impact of human-induced climate change in many regions - but there are still some areas of uncertainty. ""Where the human imprint is obvious is in the northeast of Europe. It is quite a direct link, with a warming climate and earlier snow melt,"" he said. ""However, the areas impacted by the NAO are more difficult to attribute to anthropogenic global warming. The jury is still out on that aspect."" The study foresees subtle but significant impacts that could arise from the change in flood timing. There could be effects on river ecosystems with salmon spawning later in the year. There could also be implications for hydropower stations, and for agriculture if fields stay wetter for longer. ""The more serious concern is that if warming impacts the seasonality it may also impact the scale of flooding,"" said Prof Blöschl. ""You could think of timing changes as the harbinger of future changes of flood magnitude. That is the more serious concern. If that happens, flood risk management will have to adapt and that will be different in different parts of Europe."" Other experts believe that the changes in flood timing identified by this study have significant implications for how we understand the risk of river floods and how we deal with them. ""Nearly every major city and town in Europe is built on a river and we protect this urban infrastructure by using past floods as a gauge of the potential risk,"" said Mark Maslin, Professor of Climatology at University College London. ""The study shows that this approach underestimates the risk, as climate change has made European floods occur earlier in the year, increasing their potential impact. ""This means all the infrastructure that we have built to protect our cities needs to be reviewed as much of it will be inadequate to protect us from future climate change-induced extreme flooding.""

uk-28270337,India drops arms charges against British crew of MV Seaman Guard Ohio,"Six British former servicemen who spent months in an Indian prison have had arms charges against them dropped, the Mission to Seafarers has said.","The MV Seaman Guard Ohio crew were accused of illegally possessing weapons after they were arrested last October while working on a private US-owned ship providing anti-piracy protection. Five of the six were bailed in April, but could not leave India. The charity hopes all six men will be reunited with their families soon. The Mission's director of justice and public affairs, Ken Peters, said: ""Following the judgement, we hope that the crew will be reunited with their families in the next week to 10 days, and we will continue to provide any support or advice necessary."" Detention The men were part of a 35-strong crew on board the ship when it was detained last year. While all the charges against them have been dropped, the Ukrainian captain of the ship is still facing charges of illegal bunkering, a spokeswoman for the Mission added. Billy Irving, from Connel, Argyll; Nick Dunn, from Ashington, Northumberland; Ray Tindall from Chester; Paul Towers from Pocklington, Yorkshire; John Armstrong from Wigton, Cumbria, and Nicholas Simpson, from Catterick, North Yorkshire, were arrested on 12 October last year. They were held in an Indian prison between October and April, prompting their families to petition Prime Minister David Cameron for their release. All of the men, apart from Mr Towers, were released on bail in April. Now the charges against them have been dropped, the Mission said, paving the way for them to return to the UK. Weapon store They were working for AdvanFort providing anti-piracy protection in the Indian Ocean when their ship was detained. The Indian authorities had said they had intercepted the US ship and found weapons and ammunition on board which had not been properly declared. AdvanFort said India's coastguard and police had allowed the ship into the port to refuel and shelter from a storm. It said all weapons had been properly registered. AdvanFort CEO Sam Farajallah said on Friday: ""This has been a long waited for decision and we'd like to thank everyone who had continuous faith in us, offered support and helped us get through this challenge."" A spokesman for the Home Office said: ""We are aware of reports of a court decision to quash the charges against the 6 British nationals. We are urgently seeking official clarification."""

education-42707654,Is social mobility really about school cash?,"If you took a list of the top 20 places in England where schools have the most funding, 18 of them would be in London.","Sean CoughlanEducation correspondent And if you took another list, of the top 20 places with the highest level of social mobility, 17 of them would also be in London. Is that a coincidence? Head teachers in the Worth Less? campaign over school funding shortages say that if the government is serious about promoting social mobility in education, then it needs to look at how low funding seems to mirror low mobility. West Somerset has the lowest place on the government's social mobility index - and is also one of the lowest-funded areas. The Worth Less? campaign, which has brought together about 5,000 schools over the issue of fair funding, has produced an analysis showing that a secondary school in West Somerset would receive £2m less per year than a similar sized school in Westminster. Westminster, in the top 10 for funding, is rated as giving its disadvantaged young people the highest chance of social mobility in the country. And a key aspect of the success of London's schools has been that poorer youngsters, such as those eligible for free school meals, do much better in the capital than elsewhere. Funding gaps Of course, there are many other crosswinds in such a complex topic. Schools in London get more funding because they have bigger challenges - extra costs because of their location and extra demands, such as high levels of deprivation and many pupils speaking English as a second language. It has often been claimed that London has its own demographic microclimate, with many migrant families arriving with high ambitions for their children. But head teachers argue that there's no escaping the overlap between social mobility and financial support. None of the lowest-funded 20 authorities makes it into the top 50 for social mobility. And the top 10s for funding and social mobility are shuffling very similar packs. Top 10 for funding Top 10 for social mobility Jules White, a head teacher from West Sussex who has co-ordinated the Worth Less? school funding campaign, is calling for a much closer look at what the variation in funding really means for those outside the capital. The funding gap between West Somerset and Westminster, for an individual school, is the equivalent of dozens of extra teaching staff, after-school clubs, university links, careers advice and support for pupils who are struggling. And these are exactly the kinds of added extras that could improve social mobility. Mr White, speaking at a Westminster Education Forum event on school funding, has broken down the figures to per-pupil spending. Barnsley, near the bottom for social mobility, has £4,729 for each secondary pupil, while Hackney, in the top five for social mobility, receives £7,840. How much could schools in Barnsley help their young people with an extra £1,000 per term for each of them? Or what more progress could be supported in other areas on the bottom rungs for funding, such as York, Leicestershire and West Sussex. But it's not always such a neat match between funding and social mobility. Nottingham and Manchester are among areas that are relatively well-funded, but don't do particularly well on social mobility. Tightrope act The Westminster forum on funding heard warnings that the answer was not taking money from schools in the capital. A chair of governors from a secondary school in Lambeth said that the changes proposed in the new national funding formula would leave them with a budget deficit heading towards £500,000, which could only be resolved by significant cuts in the teaching staff. Valentine Mulholland, of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the funding squeeze had already meant the loss of jobs for teaching and support staff. And a study from the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) suggested higher spending particularly benefited disadvantaged pupils. New Education Secretary Damian Hinds has made a priority of social mobility - but he will also have to make some big decisions about the pressure over school funding. The Department for Education has consistently argued that there are record levels of funding - and the NFER's Ben Durbin agreed that by international standards, England's schools are relatively well-funded. The political tightrope act for ministers is to push more cash to the less well-funded areas without damaging those schools performing well in better-funded places. But the head teachers are arguing that funding and social mobility should no longer be seen as separate conversations."
uk-england-manchester-13699084,Macclesfield's Richard Butcher died from heart condition,"A professional footballer who was found dead in his bed died from a rare heart condition, a coroner has ruled.","Macclesfield Town midfielder Richard Butcher was discovered dead at his flat in Swinton, Salford in January. The Northampton-born player, 29, had suffered chest pains in the past three years, Bolton Coroner's Court heard. In a narrative verdict, assistant deputy coroner Peter Watson said Mr Butcher died from natural causes due to a naturally occurring heart condition. ""All deaths are tragic but especially in cases with someone so young and on the face of things he was a very fit and healthy young man, it is so sad that on the balance of probabilities he died from this cardiac condition,"" Mr Watson said. 'Fit and professional' A post-mortem examination showed he died of natural causes and there were no signs of heart disease. The player suffered from the condition cardiac arrhythmia - where the heart either beats too slow or too fast. Mr Butcher's wife Sarah told the hearing he ""dedicated his career to maintaining his health and fitness"". ""He used to delight in that the younger players would remark on how fit and professional he was,"" she said. Mrs Butcher said her husband had complained of chest pains on and off for about three years. ""Every now and then he would clutch his chest and then the pain would disappear,"" she said. 'No pain' ""He would say 'I'm so fit and healthy, it's fine' and he would dismiss it really."" He underwent a series of heart tests in Lincoln in November 2009, after collapsing after a night out when he had only drunk three bottles of beer. Mrs Butcher said that he clutched his chest while working on a university assignment at his computer three days before his death, but again had shrugged it off. Pathologist Dr Simon Suvarna said such deaths were rare and that either they occurred with no warning or with previous symptoms of fainting episodes. Chest pains were not common as an indicator, he said. He said the death may have happened while Mr Butcher was asleep or had just woken but he would not have been aware or felt any pain. Mr Butcher, who also played for Kettering, Oldham, Peterborough, Notts County and Lincoln City, was described by Macclesfield Town as ""a total role model for young professionals"". The club, where he had played for a year, were concerned when he did not arrive for training on 10 January. He was later found dead. Paying tribute, his father Richard said: ""He was a lovely, lovely lad. As fit as anything. ""He always wanted to be a footballer, like every schoolboy does."" His brother Glenn added: ""I couldn't imagine him doing another job. He tried a couple of times having normal jobs but he never lasted more than a day."" Mr Butcher had planned to become a physiotherapist after his playing days, his family said."
business-36311126,UK inflation rate falls on cheaper air fares,"The UK's inflation rate fell in April for the first time since September, largely because of cheaper air fares after the Easter holidays.","The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the rate, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index, fell to 0.3%. The ONS said the main causes were falls in the prices of air fares, vehicles, clothing and social housing rents. The Bank of England said last week that it expected inflation to increase in the second half of the year. By far the largest downward effect in April came from air transport, with prices falling by 14.2%, compared with a rise of 4.5% between the same two months last year. This was influenced by the timing of the Easter holidays in March. Fare prices increased dramatically between February and March this year and then fell sharply in April. The price of clothing and footwear also fell as retailers dropped prices to try to revive sales hit by last month's cold weather. An alternative inflation measure, the Retail Prices Index, which is still used to index some rents and pensions, also fell from an annual rate of 1.6% in March to 1.3% in April. Meanwhile core inflation, which strips out energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, fell to 1.2%, compared with economists' expectations for 1.4%. Interest rates Last week, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, had to write his sixth letter to the Chancellor George Osborne explaining why CPI inflation was still below the Bank's 2% target. In it he said: ""The underlying causes of the below-target inflation of the past year and a half have been: sharp falls in commodity prices, the past appreciation of sterling, and to a lesser degree the subdued pace of domestic cost growth."" The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted last week to keep interest rates unchanged at the record low of 0.5%. The Bank is not expected to raise rates until at least next year. Martin Beck, senior economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said: ""We are likely to see inflation remain close to current rates until the latter part of the year, when the base effects associated with last winter's collapse in the oil price will begin to kick in and finally drag the CPI measure above 1%. Such a benign outlook is likely to stay the MPC's hand until well into next year."" In a separate report, the ONS said that there had been a surge in house prices as landlords rushed to buy before higher stamp duty was imposed. UK average house prices increased by 9.0% over the year to March 2016, up from 7.6% in the year to February 2016. The pound lost about half a cent against the dollar immediately after the figures were released, but then recovered to stand at $1.4483, a gain on the day of more than 0.5%."

business-26891682,Why bamboo is booming again in Taiwan,"Bamboo is ubiquitous in Chinese culture. Sturdy and tenacious, it symbolises virtue.","By Cindy SuiBBC, Taipei In fact, the plant has had a profound impact on the daily life, culture and spirituality of the Chinese. In the past, a wide variety of products were made from bamboo - from roof tiles and rafts, to shoes, furniture and agricultural tools. But despite the close relationship between Chinese-speaking societies and the natural material, Taiwan's bamboo industry has suffered a decline in recent decades. It nearly collapsed because of people's preference for more modern-looking products, or just cheaper plastic goods - and the impact of less expensive bamboo imports from China and South East Asia. Nowhere was this more apparent than in central Taiwan's Zhushan or ""Bamboo Mountain"" town. Hundreds of families used to make bamboo products there in the centre of the country's bamboo industry. Now there are only about 50. It's a trend reflected in other parts of Taiwan - only about 240 bamboo-products businesses remain on the island. ""In the past, every part of Taiwan had people working in this industry, but over the years, bamboo has been replaced by plastic or steel to make all sorts of products, such as clothes hanging poles, baby cribs, and furniture,"" says Yang Chun-hsien, director of the Forestry Bureau's reforestation and production division. However, an earthquake and strong resolve on the part of the government and industry to continue using bamboo have led to a revival and transformation in its use. In recent years, bamboo has been used to make items never before associated with the plant - from shampoo and insect repellent, to socks, gloves, and even roasted peanuts. This reinvention of how bamboo is used has made it possible for the small family businesses which make up the industry to stay alive and to start reversing the decades of decline. Health benefits? At the height of bamboo production in Taiwan in the 1970s, more than 13 million stalks were harvested each year, and sales of the stalks alone - not including the finished products - amounted to $3.5m (£2.1m) per annum. But in the past decade, the annual harvest amounted to only about 1.67 million stalks with sales adding up to just $456,000 - a little over 10% of the peak level. Production and sales, however, have been steadily climbing in recent years. Following a devastating earthquake on 21 September 1999 centred in Nantou county, where Zhushan lies, the central government decided to help the local economy by commissioning the country's non-profit Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) to find new ways to help the bamboo industry grow. ITRI developed a method to carbonise bamboo stalks to produce high quality bamboo charcoal, which has a multitude of different uses. Naturally insulating, the charcoal can be turned into fibres and woven into fabric to make hats, scarves, gloves, socks and pants. Also said to be health giving, it is increasingly added to bodycare products, such as skin creams. Meanwhile, in industry it is used to purify water and air. Yet its most unusual application has to be in the production of bamboo charcoal-coated peanuts - which look exactly as they sound - peanuts covered with charcoal. Many people who have never tasted them are queasy about giving them a try, but they actually taste good, not at all like charcoal, and are believed to have health benefits. Such diversification has bought new hope to Taiwan's bamboo industry. ""When I was growing up, the toys we played with were made of bamboo,"" says Chen Ching-fu, general manager of the Bamboo Culture Park in Zhushan - a manufacturer of bamboo product, and the first visitor attraction in Taiwan devoted to the plant. ""Bamboo was all around us, but never did we imagine bamboo can be used to make so many different types of products."" Like other businesses, Mr Chen's now sells not only traditional bamboo furniture, but other products such as air fresheners and clothing. Besides bamboo charcoal, the Taiwanese have also found ways to use the actual bamboo to make a much wider variety of products than their ancestors did, including floor panels, pens, clothes hangers and even laptop casings. Sales of goods made from all forms of bamboo in Taiwan now reach $100m, with exports increasing alongside domestic sales. New spin One of the trends helping to drive the revival of the industry is the return of second or third generation young people to help run family businesses. Lin Li-wei, 36, worked at a post office in the capital Taipei after graduating from college. But, making only about $600 a month, he came back to assist his father, who made bamboo ear diggers used by Chinese and Japanese people to remove earwax. He's now put a new spin on the family business - making modern looking clocks, lamps and wall lights out of bamboo. He has been receiving orders for his creations. ""My father supports me trying to innovate,"" says Mr Lin. ""Only through innovations can we add value to our products and continue our business."" Now he and his father make $5,000 a month. Many of the manufacturers in Zhushan are breaking even, but not making big profits. Still, they persevere, seeing it as their mission to continue to promote the use of bamboo. Bamboo grows fast - just five years to reach maturity, making it one of the most environmentally-friendly plants to use. So growers and industry leaders hope they can replace the use of many types of other wood, and plastic. ""Plastic is very cheap and can be used for a longer time, but what a shame. Bamboo is more environmentally friendly, no chemicals are used to make bamboo products, and the trees grow without the need for fertiliser or pesticides,"" said the Forestry Bureau's Mr Yang. ""Bamboo can also absorb a lot of carbon dioxide and can reduce greenhouse gases."" Back at the Bamboo Culture Park, Mr Chen has created a do-it-yourself workshop where schoolchildren and other tourists can learn how bamboo charcoal is made and make their own bamboo products. ""Taiwan can't be without bamboo because it's a material we've relied on for generations,"" says Mr Chen. ""I want to help people understand the importance and benefits of using bamboo.""

President Trump had urged protesters to march on the Capitol after making false claims of electoral fraud. Ms Patel said the president's words had fuelled the violence and he ""didn't do anything to de-escalate that"". Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the ""disgraceful scenes"" and called for a ""peaceful and orderly transfer of power"". Mr Trump has since said there will be an ""orderly transition"" to Democrat Joe Biden, whose November election victory has now been certified by US lawmakers. But he added that he continued to ""totally disagree"" with the outcome of the vote, repeating his unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud. 'Awful beyond words' Hundreds of the president's supporters stormed the Capitol - where lawmakers were meeting to confirm Mr Biden's election victory - and staged an occupation of the building in Washington DC. Both chambers of Congress were forced into recess, as protesters clashed with police and tear gas was released. Ms Patel told BBC Breakfast the scenes were ""awful beyond words"". The home secretary said: ""His comments directly led to the violence, and so far he has failed to condemn that violence and that is completely wrong."" She added: ""He basically has made a number of comments yesterday that helped to fuel that violence and he didn't actually do anything to de-escalate that whatsoever... what we've seen is completely unacceptable."" The home secretary added that America ""needs to move on"" and have the transition of power from Mr Trump to Mr Biden. A woman died after being shot by police, and three others died as a result of ""medical emergencies"", local police said. Politicians across the UK's political parties lined up to condemn the scenes in Washington. Mr Johnson tweeted: ""The United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was a ""direct attack on democracy,"" whilst Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called the events ""utterly horrifying"". Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said there was ""no justification for these violent attempts to frustrate the lawful and proper transition of power"". But senior Welsh Conservative Andrew RT Davies has been criticised after comparing the rioting to politicians who supported a second referendum on Brexit. Mr Davies, a member of the Welsh Parliament, later tweeted that ""violence must never be tolerated"". Friend of President Trump and leader of Reform UK - formerly the Brexit Party - Nigel Farage tweeted: ""Storming Capitol Hill is wrong. The protesters must leave."" President Trump later called on his supporters to ""go home"", while continuing to make false claims of electoral fraud. Twitter and Facebook later froze his accounts. Meanwhile, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey has defended the prime minister's response to the rioting. Asked on ITV's Peston programme why Mr Johnson hadn't criticised Mr Trump, she said: ""The prime minister has been clear tonight that we need a peaceful and orderly transition."" It is a truism of British diplomacy that every occupant of 10 Downing Street has to get on with every occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, regardless of their politics or character. Personal consideration is pushed aside. What matters is the national interest and staying close to one of Britain's closest allies. Thus even now, even after Donald Trump's incitement of the Capitol mob, even though there are less than two weeks until the inauguration, even as close Republican allies jump ship, Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab were reluctant to criticise the president by name in their initial response overnight. Yes, they condemned the violence. But of Mr Trump, not a word. This caution was matched by the prime ministers of fellow so-called Five Eyes intelligence allies, Australia and New Zealand, both of whom also both failed to mention Mr Trump in their condemnatory tweets. In contrast, European leaders were quick to blame the President personally. It was only this morning that a British minister, Home Secretary Priti Patel, felt able to follow suit in strong terms. So was this natural and sensible diplomatic caution in the midst of a febrile crisis? Or was this, as some Labour figures are already claiming, a function of the closeness between the current UK government and the Trump administration? It was only a few weeks ago that the Defence Secretary, Ben Wallace, told The Sun that he would miss Donald Trump because he was a good friend to Britain. Whatever one's views, it is certainly the case that the British government is seen on the international stage by some has having ideological proximity to Mr Trump. Changing that reputation is seen by many diplomats as a priority in the months ahead, a task made more urgent by events overnight."
uk-england-manchester-41284104,"Builder Michael McDonnell, jailed for 'dodgy' work","A ""dodgy builder"" whose shoddy work left a family unable to live in their dream home, has been jailed.","Michael McDonnell, 36, was convicted of engaging in unfair commercial practices by a Lancashire Trading Standards prosecution at Preston Crown Court. McDonnell, of Chorley Road, Standish, also admitted he falsely claimed membership of the Home Builders Federation. An expert witness said it was the ""worst"" case he had ever seen McDonnell not only carried out substandard work he conned his victims with fake claims that it had passed building inspections when none had taken place. Three customers, including the mother of Wigan Rugby League legend Shaun Edwards, paid out more than £200,000, said Lancashire Trading Standards. Angela Cartwright, 50, from Wrightington, Lancashire, said her husband invested his pension and the couple ploughed their life savings into the building work carried out by McDonnell. ""This is not just a dodgy builder - he grabs the money, leaves you with a mess and your dreams shattered,"" said Mrs Cartwright. Ms Cartwright said their home in High Moor Lane was condemned by a surveyor after he saw McDonnell's work. ""There's no damp proof course, the walls are built with a brick that doesn't hold the weight of the roof, basically the roof, the walls and the floor have to be taken down so we will not be able to live here,"" she said. Nick McNamara, of Lancashire Trading Standards, said McDonnell made ""lavish and extravagant claims"" about his business on a ""slick and convincing website"". He said he was ""frankly horrified when I saw the photographs"" of the Cartwright home. Expert witness and building engineer Don Waterworth, added: ""I think this is the worst I've seen in 30 years of being a surveyor and expert witness simply because there's nothing that can be saved."" He said the Cartwrights, who spent more than £100,000 on the project in September 2015, had been the victims of a ""despicable crime""."
uk-politics-45462900,Boris Johnson compares Chequers deal to 'suicide vest',"Boris Johnson has attacked Theresa's May's Brexit plan, saying she had ""wrapped a suicide vest"" around the British constitution and ""handed the detonator"" to Brussels.","In the Mail on Sunday, the former foreign secretary said the Chequers deal was ""feeble"" and ""pathetic"". He has been strongly criticised by some Tories - one minister said it marked a ""disgusting moment"" in politics. And Home Secretary Sajid Javid called for ""measured language"" to be used. Writing in the same paper, the current Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called for people to rally behind Mrs May, backing her to hold the line ""in the face of intense pressure"". The UK is leaving the EU on 29 March 2019, and the government's plan - agreed at Chequers in July - has sparked criticism from Brexiteer Tories as well as the EU. In his article, Mr Johnson accused the EU of ""bullying"" the UK - but questioned why the response had been ""so utterly feeble"". He said that rather than getting a ""generous free trade deal"", Britain is saying, ""yes sir, no sir, three bags full sir"", to Brussels. ""At every stage of the talks so far, Brussels gets what Brussels wants,"" wrote Mr Johnson. ""It is a humiliation. We look like a seven-stone weakling being comically bent out of shape by a 500lb gorilla."" He said the reason for the UK's response was the ""insanity of the so-called backstop"" - the commitment by the UK and the EU to come up with a solution to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. However, his call to scrap the proposed backstop has been heavily criticised by Sinn Féin and the SDLP. Sinn Fein said Mr Johnson's comments were ""foolish and dangerous"", while the SDLP said he had ""absolutely no regard for people on this island"". The BBC's political correspondent Alex Forsyth said the ""scathing remarks"" by Mr Johnson showed his ""willingness to challenge the prime minister remains undimmed"" after recent revelations about his private life. It is Mr Johnson's second attack on the prime minister's Brexit strategy inside a week, as last Monday he said the Chequers deal ""means disaster"" for Britain - Downing Street responded to that attack by saying he had offered ""no new ideas"". 'Hurtful analogy' While Mr Javid voiced measured criticism of Mr Johnson, other Tories reacted more angrily to his remarks. Former Army officer and chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee Tom Tugendhat graphically described the aftermath of a suicide bomb that had gone off near his office in Helmand province, Afghanistan. He said comparing such an attack to the PM's plans ""isn't funny"", adding: ""Some need to grow up"". Foreign Office Minister Sir Alan Duncan criticised his former boss, saying the article was ""one of the most disgusting moments in modern British politics."" If this latest broadside was not the end of Mr Johnson's political career, ""I will make sure it is later"", he said. Another Foreign Office minister, Alistair Burt, tweeted: ""I'm stunned at the nature of this attack. There is no justification for such an outrageous, inappropriate and hurtful analogy. ""If we don't stop this extraordinary use of language over Brexit, our country might never heal. Again, I say, enough."" But backbench Tory MP Nadine Dorries defended Mr Johnson in the face of what she was ""vitriol"", saying his critics were ""terrified of his popular appeal"". And Tory Brexiteer Andrew Bridgen said the way Mr Johnson ""says it how he sees it and speaks truth unto power"" was ""something that endears him to a huge swathe of the British public"". On the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Javid said: ""I think there are much better ways to articulate your differences. I think it's a reminder for all of us in public policy, whichever political party we represent, to use measured language because I think that's what the public want to see."" He backed the Chequers proposals which he said represented ""the only deal that we've got on the table"". In his Mail on Sunday article, Mr Hunt said Parliament would get to debate and vote on any agreement, adding: ""Until then, we should not rush to judgement on a deal that is still under negotiation."" Johnson 'dossier' It is the first public comment from Mr Johnson since he and his wife, Marina Wheeler, confirmed they were getting divorced earlier this week. The announcement followed newspaper allegations the former London mayor had been having an extra-marital affair. The Sunday Times has reported that Mrs May's aides wrote a 4,000-word ""dirty dossier"" on Mr Johnson in 2016, exposing a ""catalogue of lurid allegations"" against him. The paper says it has seen the document - said to have been written during the Conservative leadership contest - but officials at Downing Street and Conservative Campaign Headquarters have denied circulating it. No-deal 'disorder' claim Elsewhere the National Police Chiefs' Council said there was no intelligence to suggest there would be an increase in crime or disorder if the UK and the EU cannot agree a deal. NPCC operations lead Chief Constable Charlie Hall was responding to a Sunday Times report of a leaked document about police contingency plans for a no-deal Brexit. According to the paper, the document warned that concerns around medical supplies could ""feed civil disorder"", and that potential goods shortages raised concerns of ""widespread protest which could then escalate into disorder"". It also warned that the ""necessity to call on military assistance is a real possibility"" in the weeks after UK's departure from the EU. Mr Javid said he did not expect a no-deal outcome, adding: ""I'm glad the police and other experts are looking into this and thinking what might happen in a no-deal scenario."""
world-europe-20514194,France to back Palestinian bid for UN status,France has confirmed it intends to vote for Palestinian non-member status at the United Nations later this week.,"Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said France had long backed Palestinian ambitions for statehood and would vote yes ""out of a concern for coherency"". The Palestinians are asking the UN General Assembly to upgrade their status from permanent observer to a ""non-member observer state"". Israel and the US oppose the move, due to be voted on later this week. They are concerned that the Palestinians are trying to seek full statehood via the UN, rather than through negotiation as set out in the 1993 Oslo peace accords under which the Palestinian Authority was established. Washington has warned that it could hinder rather than help future dialogue. Britain 'undecided' ""You know that for years and years France's consistent position has been the recognition of the Palestinian state,"" Laurent Fabius told the lower house of parliament. ""That is why when the question is raised on Thursday and Friday, France will respond with a 'yes'."" Backing international recognition of a Palestinian state was a campaign pledge made by Francois Hollande before he became France's president earlier this year. It was a policy first set out by Francois Mitterand in 1982, and has been pursued by Mr Hollande's predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy. However, Mr Fabius cautioned that the vote came at a delicate time - with a recent ""extremely fragile"" ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, looming Israeli elections and a new administration of re-elected US President Barack Obama. ""It's only with negotiations between the two sides that we demand immediately, without any preconditions, that a Palestinian state can become a reality,"" he said. France - a permanent member of the UN Security Council - is the first major European country to come out in favour of the move. Germany is expected to vote against, while the UK's ambassador to the UN, Mark Lyall Grant, said on Tuesday that London remained undecided. According to AFP news agency, Mr Lyall Grant told reporters the UK thought the Palestinians should delay the application, but was still in talks with the Palestinian Authority and would decide ""in due time"" how to vote. Austria says it will also back the Palestinian bid and claims that more than half of the European Union's 27 member states will vote for the proposal, AFP reports. Observers say the application is likely win approval in the 193-member UN General Assembly, as it needs only a simple majority to pass. According to the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), more than 130 countries already grant the Palestinians the rank of a sovereign state. 'Unilateral steps' An upgrade in status would allow the Palestinians to participate in General Assembly debates and improve their chances of joining UN agencies and the International Criminal Court (ICC), although the process would be neither automatic nor guaranteed. If they are allowed to sign the ICC's founding treaty, the Rome Statute, the Palestinians hope to take legal action in the court to challenge Israel's occupation of the West Bank. The bid follows a failed attempt in 2011 by Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority and chairman of the PLO, to join the UN as a full member state. The proposal failed because of a lack of support in the Security Council. As well as seeking to become a non-member observer state, the latest Palestinian resolution also calls for a Middle East settlement that ""fulfils the vision of two states, an independent, sovereign, democratic, contiguous and viable state of Palestine, living side-by-side in peace and security with Israel, on the basis of the pre-1967 borders."" Israel opposes any pull-back to the 1967 lines. Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Lior Ben Dor told the BBC earlier this month that President Abbas would be in breach of the Oslo peace accords if he continued to press for UN recognition. And he warned that if the Palestinians sought to ask the ICC to resolve disputes with Israel, then Israel would ""take unilateral steps to protect its interests"". He did not elaborate on what those measures would be, but reports in the Israeli media suggested they might include halting the transfer of tax revenue to the Palestinian Authority and restricting the movement of Palestinian officials through the West Bank. President Abbas has said he does not ""want any confrontations with the United States or Israel"", adding: ""If we can start a dialogue or negotiations the day after the [UN] vote, we will."" The Palestinians have long sought to establish an independent, sovereign state in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. However, two decades of on-and-off peace talks have failed. The latest round of negotiations broke down in late 2010 over the issue of Jewish settlement building in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Attempts to restart direct talks have failed."
uk-wales-39231826,How Bristol's major trauma centre works,"Wales is to get its first major trauma centre, which will have a specialist medical team on call 24 hours a day for the most serious emergencies.","Across the Severn Bridge, Bristol has operated one of two major trauma centres (MTC) for the south west of England since 2012 - along with Derriford in Plymouth. It is estimated survival rates have improved by 30%. It started at the old Frenchay hospital before moving to the new £430m Southmead super-hospital four miles away in 2014. A cluster of six other hospitals - including Bristol Royal Infirmary - operate as major trauma units in a network around it. But Southmead, one of 27 MTCs across England, is in line to take the most critical cases first - involving up to 1,500 patients a year. Dr Ben Walton, consultant in intensive care medicine, said it offered a consistency of service which was not possible before. ""The feeling when these centres were first set up in London it would take five years to see improvements - we've seen it in 18 months,"" he said. ""In the past, if a patient was seriously injured in a road traffic collision or fell at home, they'd be taken to the nearest hospital with an emergency unit. ""Now, if they fulfil certain criteria and the assessment of the ambulance or pre-hospital doctor crew is that they're likely to have a serious injury, they will by-pass their nearest emergency department and be transferred directly to the major trauma centre."" Dr Walton said the major trauma centre could gather together multiple specialists around the clock and deal with injuries which are often complex. ""Patients are met by a trauma team which is 24/7, 365 days of the year and there will always be a senior clinician - a consultant - leading that team. ""That's of benefit to patients and can't be provided at every hospital, it's impossible."" There is a flow of patients between the other trauma units and the MTC, depending on the seriousness of their condition and stage of their care. But Dr Walton said: ""I think there's no doubt the rehabilitation of patients in our network is patchy. There's not a joined up, consistent service."" Major trauma also went beyond road crashes ""people falling or being shot or stabbed"". He added: ""A significant proportion are elderly patients with complex, pre-existing medical needs who have had what you might see as an innocuous fall or injury."""
uk-england-york-north-yorkshire-18391545,Clean-up after flash flooding in North Yorkshire,Fire engines have pumped water out of properties in North Yorkshire after heavy rain caused flash flooding.,"North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said crews dealt with flooding in properties in and around York. Two engines attended incidents in the town of Boroughbridge, while three more dealt with flooding in 15 homes in the Badger Hill district of York. The Environment Agency said a flood alert is in place for the River Foss in York. The incidents on Sunday happened on the second day of flooding in the area. Damage was caused to homes and some businesses and homes in Flaxton and Stockton-on-the-Forest following flooding caused by torrential downpours on Saturday. James Bowes, station manager at North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service, said the sheer volume of water at Badger Hill caused problems. He said: ""The initial incident was quite difficult because the water levels were still rising. After about a period of an hour levels started to drop and we were actually able to make headway using our pumping equipment."""
uk-england-bristol-22261107,Car-free Sundays in Bristol to start in June,"Car-free Sundays in Bristol's city centre will start in June, the mayor has announced.","George Ferguson said the idea was not about ""closing roads but opening them to people"" and said he hoped to see ""entrepreneurial activity"". The scheme was originally due to run weekly but will run once a month due to operating costs of £195,000. Baldwin Street, King Street and all roads in the Old City will be closed during car-free Sundays. Mr Ferguson said five days were planned this summer, with the first on 23 June. The £195,000 cost covers all five days. 'Suck it and see' He said he had been inspired by similar schemes in Bordeaux in France and Bogota in Colombia. ""I'm very keen on taking a 'suck it and see' approach and this is why we're starting on a monthly basis - if it's a success we'll move it into a weekly basis,"" Mr Ferguson said. ""I want people to feel their way and see how they to respond to it. ""It will have some costs in the early stages while we set it up, but in time I hope it becomes a natural thing with a very low cost."" He added the money would pay for marshalling the road closures and also to provide some of the entertainment. Blue badge spaces People will still be able to drive in to the city as there will be routes to the main car parks, Mr Ferguson said. He also said there would also be provision for disabled drivers and public transport would be largely unaffected. ""I don't think you can close it [the city centre] off completely but I think we can make a large amount of it pedestrian or certainly mixed use,"" Mr Ferguson said. Nick Licata who owns the Brigstow Cafe on Clare Street said he preferred the monthly plan to the original weekly idea. He said: ""I think if it remains as a Sunday special thing, if it remains once a month - then it will work. ""But we don't want this leading into a long term plan of banning cars from the city centre."""
uk-england-47318094,Birmingham pub bombings: Jury sworn in for inquests,"A brother and sister whose father was among the victims of the Birmingham pub bombings say they are hoping for ""the truth"" from the resumed inquests.","Two bombs ripped through the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs on 21 November 1974, killing 21 and injuring 220. A jury was sworn in earlier as the inquests reopened after a long fight by families. Paul Anthony Bridgewater and Michelle Sealey are among relatives attending. Mr Bridgewater, whose father Paul Anthony Davies died in the bombings, said: ""The coroner has ruled out a lot of things but we want the truth really. ""We want the truth and we want to know what happened back then. It's been too long and there's that many theories out there and unanswered questions as well."" Coroner Sir Peter Thornton said the jury of six women and five men had an ""important civic duty"" as he adjourned the inquests until Tuesday. The individual inquests could last up to six weeks, the coroner said. The jury will return verdicts on how all victims died. The hearings began with a minute's silence. Sir Peter said the inquests would not deal with the issue of who planted the bombs, adding that was a ""task of police, prosecutors and the criminal courts"". He said although a single hearing, lasting up to six weeks, the inquests would deal with ""21 separate people, 21 separate lives lost from two terrible events"". Jurors, sitting at Birmingham Civil Justice Centre, were told they would hear evidence from only a few eyewitnesses because some were ""no longer alive"". Sir Peter added: ""They will be doing their best to recollect events accurately, but we all know memory will sometimes have gaps."" He said there would be details of the so-called ""forewarning issue"", and evidence the British authorities may have received information signalling the attacks, including an alleged tip-off concerning a ""possible conversation in a local prison nearly two weeks before"". Jurors would also hear an account of ""evidence of a students' visit to a police station the evening of the bombings, which was cancelled"", Sir Peter said. Mr Bridgewater said the loved ones of victims had formed close bonds. He said: ""We are a like a close-knit family and that's what bonds us and keeps us strong."" His sister Ms Sealey added: ""It's the knockbacks that make you want to push forward even more because there is something there that we need to find out."" Inquests were opened days after the bombings but adjourned because the case was subject to a criminal investigation. The Birmingham Six were jailed for the murders and served 17 years behind bars before their convictions were quashed. Despite the subsequent overturning of the verdicts, the inquests were never reopened. Fresh inquests were ordered in 2016 but delayed because victims' families disagreed with the coroner, who ruled out naming those suspected of carrying out the bombings. But the Court of Appeal in September upheld the coroner's decision. George Jones, who lost his father John Clifford Jones, told the BBC he hoped the remit of the inquests would have been broader. ""It's an opportunity to answer a lot of questions but my own feelings and those of most of us is those avenues have been cut off by the coroner's decision of narrowing the scope,"" he said. Paul Bodman, whose father Stanley died, described the hearings as ""a tick-box exercise"". ""It's a stepping stone to see what we can get from this inquest and perhaps we can take it further,"" he said. Hearings will continue on Tuesday and Wednesday with pen portraits of each of the victims, while on Thursday, the jurors will be taken to the former sites of the pubs. Sir Peter is due to give his closing address on 28 March before the jury's deliberations start the next day. Analysis By Midlands correspondent Sima Kotecha Today marks a significant moment in this long running story. These attacks on Birmingham happened more than four decades ago - and still the families of those killed have many unanswered questions. Some of them have fought with every ounce of their energy to have the inquests into the bombings reopened to try and establish some of the detail that has been missing. Today, the coroner will begin that process of attempting to fill some of the gaps - but will it be enough? Already the scope of the inquests has been narrowed - and the crucial perpetrator issue will not be addressed so the families will not discover who was behind the killings. So what will they learn over these weeks - and will it add anything new to what they already know, even though it may not be in the public domain? The answer to the latter will assess the effectiveness of the process in their eyes. However, for the coroner and the courts, much sought after inquests taking place in the first place is likely to be viewed as a triumph.

He died at the scene. West Midlands Police said a 16-year-old boy, from Birmingham, was arrested on Monday night and remains in custody. The force said officers were supporting the victim's family and a post-mortem examination was due to take place. Officers are using special stop and search powers - where they believe there is a risk of violence or weapons are being carried - in Bordesley Green as well as the city centre and Small Heath, until 04:00 GMT on Wednesday.

uk-england-cambridgeshire-36889869,"Wyton road crash: Lorry driver opened text before fatal crash, court hears","A lorry driver opened a text message seconds before he is accused of causing a crash in which an off duty police officer died, a court has heard.","Danny Warby, 28, of King's Lynn, denies causing the death of Det Con Sharon Garrett, 48, by dangerous driving. The five-vehicle collision took place on the A141 near Wyton, Cambridgeshire, in June 2014, Peterborough Crown Court heard. Mother-of-two Mrs Garrett joined Cambridgeshire Police in 1991. Helen Guest, for the prosecution, said Mr Warby, of School Road, Runcton Holme, was driving the 13.6-tonne light goods vehicle along the A141 in Cambridgeshire when he opened a text message on his phone. The court heard his vehicle crossed the white line in the centre of the road and clipped an oncoming lorry, showering two cars in debris, before crashing into a Renault Clio which was also in the oncoming line of traffic. The Clio was driven by Mrs Garrett, who was on her way home from work. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Ms Guest said Mr Warby had opened a text message on his phone one minute and six seconds before the crash. She said: ""If you're interacting with a mobile phone, your eyes aren't on the road and your two hands aren't on the steering wheel."" Ms Guest told the court conditions at the time of the crash were good and vehicle defects were not a factor. She said Mr Warby's lorry was travelling at 53mph (85km/h) on a stretch of single carriageway restricted to 40mph (64km/h) for lorries at the time of the collision. Ms Guest said Mr Warby had been diagnosed with obstructive sleep apnoea in late 2015 and his defence lawyers would argue he experienced a micro-sleep just before the crash. The prosecution's case is that Mr Warby's reaction to apply the brakes after the first collision was ""rapid"", and not consistent with a person who had been asleep. The trial continues."
uk-politics-56823344,Leo Docherty: Minister pledges 'protection' for Troubles veterans,"The new veterans minister has pledged legislation ""soon"" to protect British troops who served during the Troubles from unfounded prosecutions.","Leo Docherty, who took up the role on Wednesday, said ministers would give ex-soldiers who served in Northern Ireland the ""protection"" they deserved. His predecessor in the role, Johnny Mercer, quit on Tuesday in protest at their treatment by the government. He was unhappy at their exclusion from a bill debated by MPs on Wednesday. The government says the Overseas Operations Bill will protect soldiers from ""vexatious claims"" for alleged historical offences in conflicts overseas. Mr Mercer said he had been ""forced"" to resign because the government had failed to deliver on promises for a similar law covering Northern Ireland. He said the government had ""abandoned people in a way I simply cannot reconcile"" in allowing ""endless investigations"" into historic killings to continue. On Wednesday, the PM's official spokesman said details of the new legislation would be announced ""in the coming weeks"". ""There is more to be done on the issue of the Northern Ireland legacy and we are committed to making progress on this as quickly as possible,"" he added. ""We are engaging with Northern Ireland parties and the community in Northern Ireland, including victims' groups as well as the Irish government, on the way forward."" Armed Forces Minister James Heappey told the BBC on Wednesday the conflict in Northern Ireland ""needs to be dealt with separately"". ""It was an internal UK counter terrorism operation, not an overseas war like Afghanistan or Iraq, so it was always going to require its own piece of legislation,"" he added. Six former soldiers who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles are currently facing prosecution. In 2019, the Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland said of 32 ""legacy cases"" it had ruled on since 2012, 17 related to republicans, eight to loyalists, and five were connected to the Army. Plans were announced last year by the government to restrict the number of Troubles killings which could be fully investigated under a new approach where ""new, compelling evidence"" would be required. But the Overseas Operations Bill would go further for other veterans, such as those who served in Iraq or Afghanistan, by proposing a five-year limit on criminal prosecutions. Ministers have already been forced into a climbdown over the scope of a proposed ""presumption against prosecution"" after this time frame. Human rights groups, former military commanders and lawyers had criticised plans in the original version of the bill for this to include torture, genocide and crimes against humanity. On Tuesday, the government announced it would accept demands from the House of Lords for the these offences to be excluded from legal safeguards. It tabled an amendment on the issue designed to replace one from Labour's Lord Roberts backed by peers earlier this month - which MPs then approved on Wednesday. Speaking ahead of the vote, Mr Docherty told MPs that ""not explicitly excluding these offences from the bill is clearly an omission that must be rectified"". He said the government had agreed to change the bill after listening to the ""very real concerns"" from MPs and peers that the bill would damage the reputation of the UK government and the armed forces internationally."
uk-england-london-33966632,Battle of Britain: Flypast for 75th anniversary of 'Hardest Day',"Aircraft including 18 Spitfires and six Hurricanes have flown over south-east England to mark 75 years since the Battle of Britain's ""Hardest Day"".","The event recalled 18 August 1940, when Bromley's Biggin Hill and other South East military bases came under attack from the German Luftwaffe. It became known as the ""hardest day"" as both sides recorded their greatest loss of aircraft during the battle. The Battle of Britain lasted throughout the summer of 1940. It was the first major campaign fought entirely in the air. BBC reporter Clark Ainsworth at Biggin Hill What a sight. Watching those iconic World War Two aircraft take to the skies above Biggin Hill was something to behold. Spectators gasped as they then circled the airfield in formation. The roar of the Merlin engines and the grace with which the Hurricane and especially the Spitfires, climb, bank, dive and weave through the air is a joy to behold. All the aircraft have now landed with spectators invited to see them up close and take pictures. And although they are beautiful to look at on the ground, it is in the sky where they truly shine. The Hardest Day commemorations in pictures The Luftwaffe flew 850 sorties, involving 2,200 aircrew, while the RAF resisted with 927 sorties, involving 600 aircrew. The RAF and German Air Force lost 136 aircraft in one day. The special commemoration, staged from the former RAF airfield at Biggin Hill, now a commercial airport, honours the pilots, engineers, armourers, operations staff and ground crews who faced attack that day. BBC iWonder - Why do we love the Spitfire? More than 3,000 spectators went to Biggin Hill to see the aircraft including squadron leader Tony Pickering who flew on the ""Hardest Day"". He said: ""I don't think I was ever afraid. You've got to make sure you don't get too enthusiastic. You couldn't take on the German air force by yourself. ""It's lovely to see these aircraft. Beautifully designed aircraft and there's no doubt about it. The people who made them... they did a good job."" Will Curtis, managing director of Biggin Hill Airport, said it was remarkable that the Spitfire was ""still a joy to fly"", adding that ""real credit"" goes to its designer RJ Mitchell. He said: ""It is as finely tuned and as well-balanced, if not better balanced, than a modern aircraft."" The day was marked with three flight formations, which took off from the airport at 13:00 BST: On 10 July, aircraft including Hurricanes and Typhoons took part in a flypast over Buckingham Palace as part of the 75th anniversary."
technology-21322183,"Google searches expose racial bias, says study of names","A study of Google searches has found ""significant discrimination"" in advert results depending on the perceived race of names searched for.","Harvard professor Latanya Sweeney said names typically associated with black people were more likely to produce ads related to criminal activity. In her paper, Prof Sweeney suggested that Google searches may expose ""racial bias in society"". Google has said it ""does not conduct any racial profiling"". In a statement to the BBC, the company said: ""We also have an 'anti' and violence policy which states that we will not allow ads that advocate against an organisation, person or group of people."" When placing ads with Google, companies are able to specify which keywords they would like to target. ""It is up to individual advertisers to decide which keywords they want to choose to trigger their ads,"" the search giant said. Arrested? The study analysed the type of advertisements that appeared on Google when certain names were searched for. It looked at Google.com's core search engine, as well as the search function of Reuters.com - which also displays Google's advertising. Prof Sweeney's investigation suggests that names linked with black people - as defined by a previous study into racial discrimination in the workplace - were 25% more likely to have results that prompted the searcher to click on a link to search criminal record history. She found that names like Leroy, Kareem and Keisha would yield advertisements that read ""Arrested?"", with a link to a website which could perform criminal record checks. Searches for names such as Brad, Luke and Katie would not - instead more likely to offer websites that can provide general contact details. ""There is discrimination in the delivery of these ads,"" concluded Prof Sweeney, adding that there was a less than 1% chance that the findings could be based on chance. ""Alongside news stories about high school athletes and children can be ads bearing the child's name and suggesting arrest. This seems concerning on many levels."" User habits However, she was reluctant to pinpoint a cause for the discrepancies, saying that to do so required ""further information about the inner workings of Google AdSense"". She noted that one possible cause may be Google's ""smart"" algorithms - technology which automatically adapts advertising placement based on mass-user habits. In other words, it may be that the search engines are reflecting society's own prejudices - as the advertising results Google serves up are often based on the most popular links previous users have clicked on. ""Over time, as people tend to click one version of ad text over others, the weights change,"" Prof Sweeney explained. ""So the ad text getting the most clicks eventually displays more frequently."" She argued that technology should be used to counteract this effect. ""In the broader picture, technology can do more to thwart discriminatory effects and harmonise with societal norms. ""Ads responding to name searches appear in a specific information context and technology controls that context."""

Ricky Gervais, David Beckham and Claudia Winkleman were among the ""revolving door of guests"" who appeared during the marathon show. But for Chris the stand out moment was a moment inspired by the listeners. ""There was a knock knock joke from a little lad called Edward. ""We super-sized it by going to do a knock, knock joke on the most famous door in the country. Number 10 Downing Street."" The presenters say that the level of listener engagement went far beyond the gags. ""Amongst the jokes and the silly stuff there were some amazing conversations happening,"" explains Chris. ""Obviously raising that amount is so special and we're so proud of everyone who did that. ""But there were times, amongst all the silly things we got to do, some amazing conversations were happening."" ""This was about jokes but doing something for Comic Relief also provides the perfect opportunity to have more serious chat about other things."" ""I saw a text message towards the end of the broadcast where somebody had heard what Greg James said about not feeling great in the last couple of weeks,"" explains Scott.

Expectant mothers have been contacted and ""alternative arrangements put in place"", a statement said. Bosses are now looking for an alternative location nearby to house antenatal services. Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital Trust chief executive Simon Wight has apologised for any disruption caused. ""The decision to temporarily suspend services is not one we have taken lightly, but one we felt to be necessary and in the best interest of mums, babies and staff,"" he said.

The trust said women due to attend the unit in the next few weeks had been given telephone numbers they may need. It said community midwifery services would be maintained."
uk-england-london-19798173,Mark Duggan death: Kevin Hutchinson-Foster 'lied about gun',"A man on trial for supplying a gun to Mark Duggan the day the 29-year-old was shot by police said he tried to ""distance"" himself from the shooting.","Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, 30, said he ""lied"" to police about handling the gun in the week before the shooting for fear of being thought of as a ""snitch"". He denies giving Mr Duggan an illegal handgun on 4 August last year. Snaresbrook Crown Court heard he had borrowed a gun for a day, but returned it a week before Mr Duggan was shot. Mr Duggan's death sparked riots in Tottenham, which led to disorder in a number of English cities and towns. Mr Hutchinson-Foster denies selling or transferring a prohibited firearm to Mr Duggan between 28 July and 5 August 2011. Barber 'pistol-whipped' Giving evidence, he said he lied to police when they asked him whether he had handled the gun in the week before Mr Duggan's death because he did not want anyone to think ""I had something to do with Mark dying"". He had used the gun to pistol-whip a barber in a hair salon in Hackney on 29 July and the blood of both men was found on the weapon, the court heard. He said he borrowed the gun ""for show"" in the confrontation with the barber, but returned it later that day. Mr Hutchinson-Foster also said he lied when he told police Mr Duggan had been part of a group of men that beat him with a gun a week earlier. Prosecutor Edward Brown QC, suggested this was an ""invented attack"" to account for the fact that his blood was found on the handgun which police found after Mr Duggan was shot. The barrister said: ""You have tried to fit your lies through the evidence as it developed."" To which Mr Hutchinson-Foster replied: ""The event did happen."" He said he had been in touch with Mr Duggan for weeks over a drugs deal, several of which took place in the hours leading up to Mr Duggan's shooting by police. 'Agitated and angry' The defendant said Mr Duggan wanted to come to Leyton to supply drugs, but in a later phone call on the way to Leyton, the defendant told the court Mr Duggan wanted him to accompany him to Tottenham to collect the drugs. But Mr Hutchinson-Foster said he could not because he had to take another girlfriend to a dance audition, and Mr Duggan went alone. Mr Hutchinson-Foster said after Mr Duggan was shot he received a phone call from a mutual friend, Mo, who was also involved in the drug deal. The defendant said: ""He was very agitated and angry at me and basically said I snitched up Mark."" As news of the shooting spread, he said he received a number of calls accusing him of being a snitch and he switched phones the day after the shooting. He said he had lied to police in an effort to ""distance"" himself from any association with events that led to the shooting of Mr Duggan. The prosecution also alleges the defendant handed Mr Duggan the gun in a shoebox, 12 to 15 minutes before he was shot and that the box bore the fingerprints of Mr Duggan, Mr Hutchinson-Foster and his girlfriend Desire Cox. Asking him about the shoebox, Mr Brand said: ""So was it just a coincidence that a person fitting your description hands over a box ending up with your fingerprints on it, with Desire Cox's fingerprints on it and Mark Duggan's?"" To which Mr Hutchinson-Foster replied ""Yes"". The trial continues."

world-europe-24825002,EU restarts talks with Turkey after three years,The European Union has opened a new round of talks with Turkey on the country's 26-year-old application to become a member.,"Negotiations had been suspended for nearly three-and-a-half years. A recent EU report criticised the police in Turkey for using excessive force during mass protests in June. But the EU Commissioner for Enlargement, Stefan Fuele, said such events only underlined the importance of Turkey's engagement with Brussels. A spokesman for the Turkish government called the latest talks a ""real turning-point"" in relations. Turkey signed an association agreement with the EU (then the European Economic Community) back in 1963. Over the years negotiations have stalled over a range of issues, including concern over freedom of speech and democracy, treatment of religious minorities, judicial reform, and ongoing tensions with Cyprus, an existing EU member. Some EU politicians worry that such a large, mainly Muslim country would change the whole character of the EU, while others point to the young labour force that Turkey could provide for an ageing Europe. 'EU benchmark' Tuesday's talks in Brussels focused on one of 35 policy areas, or chapters, in which candidate-states must meet EU standards in order to join the 28-member bloc. Chapter 22 deals with regional policy and covers job creation, competitiveness, innovation, economic growth, improved quality of life and sustainable development. Linas Linkevicius, foreign minister of Lithuania which currently chairs the EU, announced that ""further progress in the accession process"" had been made. ""We also welcome important progress on reforms that have been recently made in Turkey, in particular positive developments in the area of democracy and rule of law,"" he said. Mr Fuele said the EU must remain ""the benchmark for reform in Turkey"". ""We need more engagement, not less,"" he said. Turkey's Minister for EU Affairs, Egemen Bagis, quipped in reply: ""Stefan, I want to assure you, we are ready to not only get engaged but also get married, which metaphorically is full membership."""

Bath and North East Somerset councillors had voted to recommend the closure of Culverhay School in July. But following a review by the council's scrutiny panel and a full council meeting on Thursday, councillors have voted to keep the school open. Councillor Nathan Hartley said the school is now hoping to become a co-educational academy. He said: ""The school itself is now in the process of submitting its own bid to become an academy. ""There's also an application from a free school group. It's up to the government over the summer to decide which one of those should go through and be successful."""
uk-48394001,Students 'may have been unfairly deported' over English test cheat claims,"Foreign students may have been unfairly deported from the UK after being falsely accused of cheating in English language tests, a report has warned.","The government withdrew 30,000 visas from non-EU citizens after it emerged students were having other people sit their tests for them. The National Audit Office concluded cheating had been ""large scale"", but innocent people may have been deported. Thousands accused of cheating had since won leave to remain, it also said. The Home Office said the NAO's report highlighted ""the scale and organised nature of the abuse"", adding that 25 people had received criminal convictions for their role in the scandal. In 2014, BBC Panorama broadcast footage showing organised cheating in two English language test centres run by third parties for the non-profit organisation Educational Testing Service (ETS). The service used voice recognition technology to try to find out who had cheated by having someone else sit their test. ETS classified 97% of UK tests taken between 2011 and 2014 as suspicious, 58% as invalid, and 39% as questionable. In the wake of the findings, the Home Office shut down colleges, excluded students and cancelled visas. The head of the NAO, Sir Amyas Morse, said the Home Office ""should have taken an equally vigorous approach to protecting those who did not cheat but who were still caught up in the process, however small a proportion they might be"". ""This did not happen,"" he added. The watchdog said it could not estimate accurately how many innocent people may have been wrongly identified as cheats. As of March, 11,000 people who had taken the English tests had left the country after an accusation was made against them, the NAO said. One student accused in 2014, who did not want to use his real name, told the BBC's Today programme the Home Office tried to deport him in 2017 and kept him in a detention centre for seven days. ""All this actually made my life really miserable, I cannot even finish my studies,"" he said. At the beginning of May he launched an appeal to clear his name. He is waiting to hear the result. Last month, a woman who came to the UK from Bangladesh in 2010 told the Victoria Derbyshire programme she also had at one stage been detained after being accused of cheating. Fatema Chowdhury, who finished her law degree at the University of London in 2014, denied the allegation and said no evidence of her alleged cheating had been presented to her. She is not currently being threatened with removal from the UK, but while remaining in the country cannot work or use the NHS for free. She said her ""dreams and hopes"" had disappeared, and she was ""desperate"" to speak to someone at the Home Office to ""prove my innocence""."

Mr Scott flagged up the B709 - one of Britain's longest B roads - as being at the ""heart of Borders cycling"" in the Innerleithen and Peebles areas. He said he was not looking for a ""quick fix"" in the current financial climate but simply that the road was not forgotten. Mr Scott told a full council meeting: ""The B709 Heriot to Innerleithen road is listed as an official Borders cycle route with the aim of attracting touring cyclists to enjoy the scenery and spend money in the Borders. ""Several sections of the road, particularly towards Innerleithen, are presently in a state of serious disrepair, and hazardous not only for cars, but particularly for cyclists. ""May I ask that at the least, the most hazardous sections of the B709 be considered for inclusion as a matter of priority in the roads department's scheme of works and overlays for the year 2019/20."" 'Reactive maintenance' In response, Gordon Edgar, the council's executive member for roads and infrastructure, told the chamber the route was inspected every two months. ""Any defects noted during these inspections are recorded and instructions are issued to carry out reactive maintenance as required within the timescale guidelines,"" he said. ""Some sections of the B709 road are listed as 'being considered for possible inclusion' in future surface treatment programmes,"" he added. He said that the overall condition of the network meant they could not permanently treat all identified sections and had to apply a ""prioritisation process"" to deliver an annual programme within budget."

The teenagers have been arrested on suspicion of arson and two counts of burglary. Sergeant Michael Hughes said the incident was being treated as ""deliberate ignition"". Police said entry was gained to the North West Learning Disability Centre, with a sum of money believed to have been taken from a till. The teenagers have also been arrested in relation to a burglary at a fast food outlet between 05:10 and 05:25 GMT on Saturday.

He faces dangers including sharks, storms, swarms of jellyfish, and extremely low water temperatures. He is hoping to raise awareness for climate change, and a team of scientists will conduct research during the 5,500 mile (9,000 km) swim. They will study plastic debris, the effect of extreme exercise on the heart and examine how the Fukushima nuclear disaster has affected the ocean. Mr Lecomte, who lives in the US, has been preparing with hours of open water swimming every day. He has also practised ""visualisation and dissociation"" exercises to ensure he is mentally ready. ""The mental part is much more important than the physical,"" he told AFP news agency. ""You have to make sure you always think about something positive."" ""When you don't have anything to occupy your mind it goes into kind of a spiral, and that's when trouble starts,"" he says. Preparations for the trip have taken more than six years, but Mr Lecomte has been targeting the challenge for much longer. In 1998, he made the first known solo trans-Atlantic swim covering 6,400km (4,000 miles) in 73 days. When he finally reached dry land in France, his first words were ""never again"", but he was soon looking for a new challenge. ""It didn't take that long for me to change my mind,"" he told NPR. ""Three, four months afterwards I was already thinking about my next adventure and doing something kind of the same.""

world-asia-42178873,What North Korean Hwasong-15 missile launch pictures tell us,North Korea has released pictures and videos of its controversial launch of a new missile which it claims can hit anywhere in the mainland United States.,"The images feature North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and several high-ranking military officials celebrating as the Hwasong-15 takes off. This is what we have learnt. The rocket is enormous Many observers have been struck by the missile's vast size - this undated picture released by state media of Mr Kim dwarfed by the rocket he is inspecting gives an idea of its scale. Michael Duitsman, a research associate at the Centre for Nonproliferation Studies, noted that the missile was much bigger than its previous iteration the Hwasong-14, and added: ""Only a few countries can produce missiles of this size, and North Korea just joined the club."" Some have also noted that the rocket appears to have more sophisticated steering and thrusters. The ""new, more capable missile"" seems to have a more powerful propulsion system with two main engines and looks like it can carry more than twice as much propellant, David Wright of the Union of Concerned Scientists told Reuters news agency. It also has a larger and blunter nose cone, which could mean it can carry a ""super-large heavy"" nuclear warhead on its tip, as Pyongyang claims. All this means that the missile appears capable of transporting a nuclear warhead for a long distance and possibly surviving atmospheric re-entry. North Korea claims that the Hwasong-15 is a viable intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). There is a new transporter Photos and videos also appeared to show the missile launching from a platform, and not from a mobile launcher which North Korea has used in previous missile tests. A large nine-axle vehicle transported the rocket to the site. Analysts believe this arrangement was due to the missile's large size, and means it needs more time to launch. In a situation when snap responses need to be made, ""this makes a big difference during crises,"" said NK Pro analyst Scott LaFoy. The launch took place against a striking backdrop of a night sky filled with stars, with a noticeable but perhaps unsurprising absence of light pollution. It was celebrated with cigarettes A jubilant Mr Kim is seen in many of the pictures, grinning as the rocket takes off. The missile's steep trajectory can be seen on screens in the background, apparently charted in real time. It is believed to be North Korea's highest-ever missile, and Pyongyang said it achieved a height of 4,475km (2,780 miles). Mr Kim and his coterie appeared to waste no time in celebrating the successful launch - with cigarettes. It is not known how far away the viewing platform was from the launch site, but Mr Kim may have form in smoking in the vicinity of fuel-laden missiles - some believe this video from July shows him puffing on a cigarette right next to a Hwasong-14."
uk-wales-46453692,Caerphilly council pay row costs to exceed £4m by 2019,"A long-running dispute over pay rises for senior officers at Caerphilly council will have cost more than £4m by next year, a report has said.","Members will be asked to set aside an extra £242,000 to pay for an ongoing investigation and the salary of former chief executive Anthony O'Sullivan. He was suspended on full pay in 2013 amid allegations of misconduct, but the charges were dropped before trial. Council leader David Poole said the ongoing issue was ""hugely frustrating"". Mr O'Sullivan was suspended, along with his deputy Nigel Barnett and the head of legal services Daniel Perkins, after the Wales Audit Office declared their pay rises were unlawful. It had been claimed they had agreed to give themselves a 20% increase when most other council staff faced pay freezes. Criminal charges against the three men were dropped in 2015, and Mr Barnett and Mr Perkins left their jobs in October last year with compensation payouts between them of nearly £300,000. But Mr O'Sullivan has yet to reach agreement with the council and remains on special leave. The head of the investigation estimated the matter would not be resolved until March at the earliest, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Mr Poole said: ""It's disappointing and hugely frustrating that we are being asked to provide further funding to allow this investigation to reach a conclusion. ""We are facing significant cuts over the next few years and none of us want to see our shrinking budgets being diverted away from frontline services."" He said the council was ""bound by a statutory process which is completely outside of our control and it is absolutely essential that we fully comply with relevant employee legislation"". The additional funds will cover the costs of the continued investigation and Mr O'Sullivan's salary until the end of July.

""I have no confidence that this matter will be resolved by the end of July 2019, and I fear it could go on much longer."" Councillors will consider the report on 13 December."
world-europe-54686284,Nagorno-Karabakh conflict: US-brokered ceasefire frays soon after starting,"Armenia and Azerbaijan have accused each other of violating the latest ceasefire over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, minutes after it came into effect on Monday.","The US-brokered ceasefire had been announced in Washington on Sunday. Two other ceasefires agreed earlier this month over the conflict were broken almost immediately. Fighting erupted on 27 September around the mountainous enclave. The conflict has intensified again in recent days. The ""humanitarian ceasefire"" was announced on Sunday in a joint statement released by the US, Armenian and Azerbaijani governments. It came into effect at 08:00 local time (04:00 GMT) on Monday. The announcement followed discussions between US Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun, Armenian Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan and his Azerbaijani counterpart Jeyhun Bayramov. The US state department said agreement was reached following intense negotiations. US President Donald Trump tweeted on Sunday to congratulate those involved. However, within minutes of the ceasefire coming into effect, Azerbaijan accused Armenian forces of shelling the town of Terter and nearby villages in ""gross violation"" of the agreement. Armenia's defence ministry said Azerbaijani artillery had fired on military positions in various parts of the front line after the ceasefire agreement had begun. In a post on Facebook, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan insisted his country ""continues to strictly adhere to the ceasefire regime"". Hikmet Hajiyev, a spokesman for the Azerbaijani president, said Armenia was trying to ""preserve the status quo based on occupation"", adding: ""The Azerbaijani side is exercising restraint."" Refugees watch and hope as fighting rages At the scene: Olga Ivshina, BBC News, Barda, Azerbaijan Schools in the town of Barda are crowded but there are no lessons here. Schoolchildren are staying home because of the coronavirus outbreak and their classrooms are now occupied by refugees from the Terter region of Azerbaijan. Shelling there hasn't stopped since the first day of the fighting. Ostagamed Isfandyarov, now living in the school with his family, proudly shows me his grandson's drawings of a Kalashnikov assault rifle, a machine gun and a rocket propelled grenade. ""Look at how precise the details are,"" he says. In the pictures tanks and helicopters shoot at each other. These young boys are yet another generation growing up thinking war is just a part of life. And these are not the first families to have left everything behind. Thousands of Azerbaijani refugees from the first Karabakh war are still living in state-funded dormitories. Conditions are pretty basic but for these refugees there is only one problem with where they have been living for the past 30 years - it isn't home. When I arrived I found them glued to the TV waiting for news about the villages and towns being taken by the Azerbaijani army. Finally, they tell me, this could be our chance to go home. Mediators from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) are also due to meet again on Thursday to discuss the conflict. Two earlier ceasefires brokered by Russia have failed to hold. The president of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, has also warned Russia not to get involved militarily in the conflict. Nagorno-Karabakh is recognised internationally as part of Azerbaijan but is under ethnic Armenian control. Clashes that began in the region in September quickly escalated into a large-scale conflict, with the shelling of towns and cities and the alleged use of banned cluster munitions. Several thousand people have died and shelling has killed civilians on both sides. Tens of thousands have fled their homes. More on the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict:"
world-latin-america-50587028,Colombians turn out in memory of dead protester Dilan Cruz,"Tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets of the Colombian capital, Bogotá, in memory of a teenage protester who died on Monday.","Dilan Cruz was hit by a projectile fired by riot police during an anti-government protest on Saturday. His death has caused outrage and further fanned anger at the government of President Iván Duque. The president has been meeting protest leaders this week to attempt to put an end to the disruption. Many of the protesters denounced the Esmad, the riot police squad which fired the projectile which hit Mr Cruz. Others said the Colombian state was ""a killer"" because of what happened to the 18-year-old student. The protests started a week ago when trade unions and student groups convened a march attended by a quarter of a million people. Their demands are wide-ranging and include calls for the government to drop a proposed tax reform and a thorough implementation of the peace agreement signed with left-wing Farc rebels in 2016. Since the death of Mr Cruz, protesters have added the demand for the dissolution of the riot police force Esmad to their demands. The protest was not confined to the capital. There were also marches in Cali and other Colombian cities. Many of those taking part in rallies on Wednesday were young people demanding better access to education and employment. ""I'm marching so we 21 year olds can have the chance of a good job,"" Jean Carlo Hernandez told Reuters news agency. ""Dilan could have been me. We're facing a government that doesn't want to help young people move ahead even though we're the future,"" he added. The marches of Wednesday were largely peaceful with members of the conservatory of music of the National University taking part playing their instruments while aerial artists and breakdancers also joined in. After meeting protest leaders on Tuesday, President Duque ruled out the dissolution of the riot squad, arguing it formed a key part of the security forces. But the president said he shared protesters' urgency to get anti-corruption legislation passed. All pictures subject to copyright. You may also be interested in:"
uk-politics-24901566,"Openness needed on Whitehall deals, says watchdog","Ministers must ensure openness over the performance of private contractors or face a ""crisis of confidence"", the National Audit Office has warned.","Firms such as Serco, Capita, G4S and Atos were being paid hundreds of millions of pounds each year, it said. But the spending watchdog called for more punishments - such as fines and exclusions from future contracts - where ""problems"" were reported. The government said it was working to create better value for money. The National Audit Office (NAO) has published two reports looking at major public service contracts. It said Serco's were worth £1.8bn, including £611m with the Ministry of Defence and £382m with local government. Capita's totalled £1.08bn, while those for G4S and Atos were £718m and £683m respectively. 'Political fallout' The NAO said the Cabinet Office, which oversees much of central government, often lacked ""commercial experience and expertise below senior levels"", and information on its 40 strategic suppliers was ""inconsistent and incomplete"". The public sector profit margins for Serco appeared to be between 0% and 9%, between 1% and 10% for Capita, and between 3% and 22% for Atos. G4S made an overall loss on some of its public sector contracts last year, giving an overall return ranging from -8% to 16%. The reports mentioned continuing investigations into issues with contractors, including the Ministry of Justice looking at the way G4S and Serco had billed it for electronic tag monitoring. The NAO said: ""Transparency is needed to ensure that no-one within the contractor can hide problems and that it is in the contractors' commercial interest to focus on their client's (the government's) needs."" Companies would ""likely concentrate on maintaining shareholder value"", it said, adding: ""Government needs to ensure that it is in the contractors' financial interests to focus their control environment more widely on meeting the standards expected of public service. ""This involves using contractual entitlements to information, audit and inspection to ensure standards are being met. ""And it is likely to involve financial penalties, banning from competitions and political fallout when problems are found."" 'High-profile failures' NAO head Amyas Morse said there was ""a crisis of confidence at present, caused by some worrying examples of contractors not appearing to treat the public sector fairly, and of departments themselves not being on top of things."" He added: ""While some government departments have been admirably quick off the mark and transparent in investigating problems, there is a clear need to reset the ground rules for both contractors and their departmental customers."" The Institute for Government's director of research Tom Gash said: ""The current pace and scale of outsourcing outstrips the ability of Whitehall officials to design and manage complex contracts effectively. ""Government should therefore phase changes when outsourcing services for the first time and avoiding contracts that lock taxpayers into service models that can quickly become outdated when policies, technologies or provider capabilities change. ""Without a more transparent and measured approach to outsourcing, high-profile failures are likely to multiply."" But a Cabinet Office spokesman said: ""Last year alone we saved taxpayers £3.8bn from our commercial reforms, including renegotiating contracts with our largest suppliers, and we welcome the NAO's recognition of our achievements. ""Since the general election we have made it easier for smaller businesses to work with Whitehall and many more are winning contracts."" He added: ""We know that the civil service lacks commercial capability and that contract management needs to be improved. ""Our reform programme seeks to address this but we must accelerate change to save taxpayers more, create better quality public services and promote growth."""

uk-politics-12657524,David Cameron says enterprise is only hope for growth,"With no money left in the government coffers, the ""only strategy"" for growth is to get behind Britain's entrepreneurs, David Cameron has said.","By Brian WheelerPolitical reporter, BBC News In a speech to his party's spring conference, the PM declared war on the ""enemies of enterprise"" - and said he was on the side of ""go-getters"". And he vowed 23 March's Budget would be the ""most pro-growth this country has seen for a generation"". But Labour accused Mr Cameron of ""warm words but no action"". Chancellor George Osborne has already told the Tory conference in Cardiff that his Budget will be ""unashamedly pro-growth"" and will include 10 new enterprise zones to boost some of the most deprived areas of England. 'Spark of initiative' Mr Cameron used his speech to reinforce his pro-growth message, and to promise a ""fundamental rebalancing of our economy"" with ""less debt, more saving; less borrowing, more investment; less dependence on financial services, more new industries, exports and trade"". With interest rates at a record low, and no money to spare, the prime minister said he wanted to champion the growth and ingenuity of the British people. He said: ""The spark of initiative. The courage to make your dream happen. The hard work to see it through. ""There's only one strategy for growth we can have now and that is rolling up our sleeves and doing everything possible to make it easier for businesses to grow, to invest, to take people on. ""Back small firms. Boost enterprise. Be on the side of everyone in this country who wants to create jobs, and wealth and opportunity."" 'Social good' On a practical level, Mr Cameron promised to open up government procurement processes to more small businesses. ""I can announce today that we are taking on the enemies of enterprise. ""The bureaucrats in government departments who concoct those ridiculous rules and regulations that make life impossible for small firms. ""The town hall officials who take forever to make those planning decisions that can be make or break for a business - and the investment and jobs that go with it. ""The public sector procurement managers who think that the answer to everything is a big contract with a big business and who shut out millions of Britain's small and medium sized companies from a massive potential market."" 'Reckless plan' Mr Cameron said ""enterprise is not just about markets - it's about morals too"", adding: ""We understand that enterprise is not just an economic good, it's a social good."" And he said the Conservatives had always been a ""party of builders and businesswomen; electricians and engineers; roofers and retailers"". ""At its beating heart this is still a party of start-ups, go-getters, risk-takers. ""What drives us is getting things done - and what drives us mad is the bureaucracy, the forms, the nonsense getting in our way."" It was speech that focused almost exclusively on domestic issues, but he did touch on Libya and repeated his call for Colonel Gaddafi to ""go"". He also urged Conservative activists to vote against changing the voting system in the referendum on 5 May. 'Reheated rhetoric' Labour has accused the Conservatives of lacking a strategy for growth and being more interested in grabbing headlines. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: ""When we urgently need a plan for jobs and growth to get the economy moving again and help hard-pressed families all David Cameron and George Osborne can offer is empty words but precious little action. ""All we've heard from this conference is the reheated rhetoric and warmed up policies of 30 years ago - a VAT rise, deep spending cuts, knee-jerk deregulation and enterprise zones which didn't work when they were tried in the 1980s. ""If David Cameron wants to know who is the real enemy of enterprise and growth in Britain today he only needs to look next door at his own chancellor. ""It is George Osborne's reckless plan to cut too deep and too fast, which has seen the economy go into reverse. """

The ONS has started analysing internet traffic volume for the first time, using publicly available data from one of Britain's largest internet exchanges. However, it acknowledges the early results are not conclusive. One expert told the BBC the data used had a significant limitation because it was unlikely to have included box-set streaming. Spotting trends The study made use of data from the London Internet Exchange (Linx), which connects internet service providers and content delivery networks. It operates exchanges in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Manchester, but some of the data was extrapolated from the London area alone. Andrew Ferguson from the news website ThinkBroadband told the BBC that while the study had merit, often online box-set viewing will not be included in Linx data as this is delivered in a different way. ""This is not the full story but when combined with other data can reveal trends, rather than absolute figures,"" he said. While the ONS said it was still working on the statistics, it found that internet traffic in the UK increases in winter and decreases in summer. Other insights included that traffic: The ONS made comparisons with other data such as road traffic information - for example, matching an increase in traffic on the M25 motorway around London during the time that internet data traffic was lower, as people commuted home after work. This approach also revealed some interesting behaviours around special events: there was not a significant spike in data flow during online shopping sale cyber- Monday, and during the England v Croatia football World Cup semi-final in 2018 there was more data exchanged during half time and before the extra time at the end of the match than there was during game itself. ""Insights on large-scale events such as adverse weather and sports could potentially help to provide measurements of economic impact over time,"" wrote Philip Stubbings, lead data scientist at the ONS Data Science Campus."

The agency forms part of the Treasury's plans to generate £5bn through ""corporate and financial asset sales"". It has not been revealed whether the plan could involve a share offer or another means of investment. Ordnance Survey (OS), which changed from being a government department to a government-owned company (GovCo) in April, employs 1,200 people at its Southampton headquarters.

""Ordnance Survey will work with the shareholder executive to ensure continued success in Great Britain and long-term growth of the organisation."" The company said the announcement would not have any impact on staff and any future changes would involve full staff engagement. Up to £4.6bn of assets have been identified through the Spending Review. The government will also ""explore the sale"" of its 49% shareholding in NATS - the national air traffic control service, which is based in Hampshire. NATS became a Public Private Partnership (PPP) in 2001 and is now 42% owned by a consortium of airlines. Heathrow Airport Holdings owns 4% and 5% is held by an employee share trust. A NATS spokesperson said: ""Any potential change in its stake in the company is a matter for government and other shareholders. ""NATS has delivered significant operational improvement and good financial results since the PPP."" The government said any sale of assets was subject to a value for money assessment.

There's a mixture of relief and frustration amongst Conservative MPs from the South who are telling me he'd boxed himself in, left with no option but to abandon plans most of them supported. But he can rightly claim he was rescued by growth in the economy. With new enterprise zones in Dorset, Hampshire and the Thames Valley, he is backing further growth, not least in new house building. He's plotted a course to sell off mapmaker Ordnance Survey and a share of British air traffic control - both big employers in the South. And he's telling councils they can keep the cash from selling assets they own - from shops to farms to golf courses, as well as offering them a way to fund social care with a council tax rise."

The trial has been agreed after ""extensive preparation"" and assessment of the risk of bare legs being cut on broken glass, one council said. A few UK councils already allow shorts. Refuse loaders from South Cambridgeshire, Cambridge City and Huntingdonshire councils donned their shorts for the first time on Monday and will be allowed to wear the knee-length attire until October. Crew member Gordon Cullum said working in last summer's high temperatures had proved ""very challenging"". ""This has definitely lifted our spirits - it's already feeling a lot cooler for us when we're wearing shorts rather than trousers,"" he said. 'Risk of shorts' Rosy Moore, Cambridge City Council's executive councillor for climate change, environment and city centre, said: ""The Greater Cambridge shared waste service has more than 150 frontline bin collection staff, with each crew emptying up to 1,300 bins during a typical day."" Each crew member walks the equivalent of about 12 miles (19km) during their shift, a South Cambridgeshire District Council spokesman said. Huntingdonshire has about 80 staff which collect an average of 23,000 bins a day. The trial will be ""carefully monitored"" and the ""risk of wearing shorts while emptying bins has been evaluated as part of this process"". ""Residents can play their part by keeping glass inside their recycling bin only and not in additional clear sacks,"" he said. The spokesman said he was aware of two other councils in the Midlands which currently allow refuse workers to wear shorts, as well as one in Wales and one in Scotland. The wearing of shorts has proved controversial in the past for rubbish collectors. In 2005 binmen in Dunfermline threatened industrial action when they were told they could not wear shorts in hot weather."

For Tracy Earnshaw, who lives a stone's thrown from pubs and bars in the town, their fun has been her nightmare. ""It's quite demoralising knowing we are going to get night after night of broken sleep. ""We will get wing mirrors ripped off cars, cars will get keyed, they will run over the bonnets and roofs of cars."" Door kicked in She said years of rowdiness had been ""destroying"" for and her family. ""It's petty crime, but it just goes on and on. ""I've had my front door kicked in, a brick thrown through my window and I've been flashed at. ""You do wonder what it'll be next."" Newquay has been known as a party venue for years, with about 30 bars and clubs in the town centre. But the deaths of teenagers Paddy Higgins and Andrew Curwell in the space of nine days last summer led to some sober thinking. Both had fallen from cliffs after going to Newquay to celebrate the end of exams. Paddy had reportedly been served sambuca liqueur in a restaurant before his death. But how to curb the antics of thousands of teenagers hell-bent on having a good time? After a demonstration by local people calling for change, police, the local authority, pub and club owners and campsites came up with Newquay Safe. Youth workers at campsites are on hand to offer advice to teenagers who are transported to and from the town by a special bus service so they can attend venues which offer alcohol-free events. Licensed premises have also agreed not to sell alcohol to anyone who looks under 18 without a passport or driving licence. Police will be welcoming teenagers arriving in the town with sniffer-dog searches and any alcohol found on under-age people will be confiscated. Councillors from the area have also been talking to pupils at schools around the country, urging them to ""be responsible and be safe"". But Guy Thomas, Newquay town centre manager, said parents should not be expect the authorities to be chaperones. ""I had an email from a parent last week who had heard on the grapevine that if they sent their 15-year-old daughter to Newquay we would provide an independent policeman for the duration of their visit. ""Clearly that is not something we are going to be doing."" And he said the changes were no guarantee against another death. ""We will never be able to legislate for personal choice or for people who decide to go off and do something completely stupid. ""We can only handle that as it happens, but there are much more stringent measures in place this year. ""Ultimately, the strength we have is we're all working together."" In a test of the new measures nearly four weeks ago, two 15-year-old Bristol girls were sent home from Newquay after being found drunk and unaccompanied. The town is still relatively quiet at the moment, so the real test will come at the height of the holiday season when the town's population of 20,000 swells to 120,000. Paddy Higgins's father, John, said: ""We will only know if they've worked after the season and the years after. ""We have just got to hope they are going to be enough.

Experts have predicted it is ""highly likely"" the species - known as the Highland tiger - will become extinct without the intervention. EU funding worth £3.2m has been secured to develop a reintroduction centre in the Highland Wildlife Park at Kincraig. The cats will be raised away from public view to minimise interaction with humans before their release. Potential release sites are being explored within the Cairngorms National Park. The project is being led by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland which runs the wildlife park. Helen Senn, head of conservation, said: ""Wildcats are on the brink of extinction in Scotland but it's not too late. ""Using wildcats from the existing captive population, as well as cats from Europe to boost the gene pool, the reintroduction centre will provide a sustainable source of wildcats for years to come."" The Scottish wildcat is the only native member of the cat family still found in the wild in Britain. 'Functionally extinct' For the past few years, conservationists have been focusing on five ""priority areas"" in Scotland. Their main defence has been to trap, neuter, vaccinate and release feral cats in those regions to minimise harm to the wildcat populations. But a study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature declared Scottish wildcats to be ""functionally extinct"" because of hybridisation with feral or domestic cats. It examined DNA from hundreds of dead and living wildcats and found they were part of the same hybrid gene pool as domestic cats. But wildcats have been bred in captivity since the 1970s and they now have a stronger genetic link to their ancestors. To prevent further hybridisation, Martin Gaywood from Scottish Natural Heritage believes it is important cat owners neuter and vaccinate their pets. He added: ""Releasing species into the wild for conservation purposes is very complex and challenging. ""With the first wildcats expected to be released into the wild in 2022, now is the time for a public discussion on domestic and feral cat populations, and how we manage these, and the public will have an important role in helping minimise future hybridisation."" A breeding team at the wildlife park has managed to double the number of wildcats in captivity in the UK to 120 over the last five years. Four are on public display at Kincraig with a further nine living in large enclosures out of view to minimise human interaction. The rest are held in zoos and private collections across the UK. The project will use existing cats to breed another generation which will be the ones selected for release. Each will be fitted with a GPS collar which allows their movements to be monitored for about the first year of their lives."
uk-england-leeds-50236691,Pontefract Hospital staff shortages lead to closures,A birth centre and beds in a stroke unit are to be shut due to staff shortages at Pontefract hospital.,"The Mid Yorkshire Hospitals Trust said it would close the hospital's Friarwood Birth Centre ""on the grounds of safety"" until next October. It is also closing 12 of the 42 beds at the hospital's stroke and rehabilitation unit. MP Yvette Cooper called the midwife unit closure ""an absolute disgrace"". Martin Barkley, the trust's chief executive, said the hospital was struggling to recruit in a ""national shortage of midwives"". ""Nor is it fair to our staff to continue to stretch our midwifery resource so thinly"", he added. The trust would still offer midwifery-led facilities at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield and Dewsbury Hospital, it said. It would continue to run antenatal and postnatal clinics at Pontefract and the closure would be reviewed next autumn. 'Absolutely criminal' Ms Cooper, Labour MP for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford, said: ""It's an absolute disgrace that our midwife-led maternity unit is set to close for nearly a year due to a national shortage of midwives."" The MP said she had already been to see the Health Secretary Matt Hancock ""but he has completely failed to do anything about it"". The temporary reduction for stroke rehabilitation and other post-operative care was because of ""less pressure on the beds"" at Pontefract for these patients, said the trust. John Trickett, Labour MP for Hemsworth, said of the stroke closures: ""It is absolutely criminal that they [NHS staff] are not being given the support they need to properly do their job.""

business-28409604,Netflix profits double to $71m as subscriptions rise,"Online video service Netflix reported profits of $71m (£42m) in the second quarter, more than double compared with the same period a year ago.","The company said revenue from its streaming content service rose nearly 50% to $1.2bn, compared to $837m a year earlier. Netflix said it added 1.69 million users during the period from March to June. The streaming video firm now has 50 million users in over 40 countries. Netflix has sought to upend the television industry by commissioning original content for its streaming-video platform and taking on established brands like HBO. Viewers have reacted positively to shows like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black. Last year, the company's original programming was nominated for 14 Emmy TV awards, winning three, and this year its programming garnered a record 31 nominations. However, the company has recently suffered some setbacks in the US, as it has battled with internet service providers (ISPs) such as Verizon over who must pay for the increasing pressure that streaming video puts on download speeds. Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings has been a vocal opponent of Comcast's proposed $45bn purchase of Time Warner Cable, fearing it would lead to too much consolidation in the industry. In a letter to shareholders announcing the earnings, Mr Hastings wrote, ""Our focus on strong net neutrality, including interconnection, is about preventing large ISPs from holding our joint customers hostage with poor performance to extract payments from us."" Shares in Netflix - which are already up 22% for the year - rose nearly 2% in trading after US stock markets had closed."
uk-england-tees-48474652,Whorlton Hall abuse: Care watchdog launches investigations,The health watchdog is launching a review into how it handled a 2015 report raising concerns about Whorlton Hall hospital.,"Former Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspector Barry Stanley-Wilkinson said he wrote the report four years before BBC Panorama revealed the alleged abuse of patients. The CQC said there would also be a review of its regulation of the County Durham hospital between 2015 and 2019. Ten workers have been arrested. BBC Panorama's undercover filming appeared to show patients with learning difficulties being mocked, intimidated and restrained. The site had at least 100 visits by official agencies in the year before the abuse was discovered. The CQC said it has commissioned David Noble QSO to undertake an independent review into how it dealt with issues raised by Mr Stanley-Wilkinson. It has previously said his draft report raised no concerns about abusive practices. Opportunities 'missed' A second, wider, CQC investigation ""will include recommendations for how its regulation of similar services can be improved, in the context of a raised level of risk of abuse and harm"". Responding to the announcement, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he had been ""appalled"" by the abuse allegations and was ""determined to ensure lessons are learnt so this never happens again"". He said: ""It is clear that opportunities to intervene were missed and we must be open and transparent in getting to the bottom of why this happened."" Seven men and three women were arrested at addresses in Barnard Castle, Bishop Auckland, Darlington and Stockton last week. They were being questioned about offences relating to abuse and neglect at the privately-run NHS-funded unit, Durham Police said. Cygnet, the firm that runs the 17-bed hospital unit, has said it was ""shocked and deeply saddened"" by the allegations."
uk-politics-20217901,Nadine Dorries suspended as Tory MP in I'm a Celebrity row,Nadine Dorries has been suspended by the Conservative Party over her decision to appear on ITV1's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here.,"The Mid-Bedfordshire MP has had the whip withdrawn, a party source said. Ms Dorries will be the first sitting MP to appear on the show, which could see her being away from her job in the Commons for up to a month. The chief whip will meet her when she returns from Australia, when she will be expected to explain herself. The Conservative Party is concerned about Ms Dorries' inability to do parliamentary and constituency business while she is taking part in the programme. Ms Dorries said she wanted to use her appearance on the reality show to raise awareness of issues she is interested in, such as reducing the time limit on abortions from 24 weeks to 20 weeks. 'Heated debates' ""I'm doing the show because 16 million people watch it. Rather than MPs talking to other MPs about issues in Parliament, I think MPs should be going to where people go,"" she told the Daily Mail. ""I'm not going in there to upset people, but I have opinions. There are certain causes that I'm interested in, one of which is '20 Weeks'. ""I will be talking about this issue around the campfire. I hope there will be some lively, heated debates."" But she has come in for criticism over her decision to enter the celebrity jungle, with Home Secretary Theresa May saying: ""Frankly, I think an MP's job is in their constituency and in the House of Commons."" Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston said Ms Dorries should resign, telling the BBC: ""I was horrified, frankly. I think it just makes her look ridiculous and it brings politics into disrepute."" Paul Duckett, chairman of the Mid-Bedforshire Conservative association, said members may consider sacking Ms Dorries over her appearance on the show, adding that he had only learned about Ms Dorries appearance when media arrived in the constituency on Tuesday morning. Mr Duckett said Ms Dorries was a hard-working MP but the appearance might ""detract from the gravitas"" of her role. Prime Minister David Cameron - who has publicly clashed with Ms Dorries in the past - earlier refused to be drawn into the row, saying: ""Nadine Dorries can speak for herself on this issue."" 'Z-list celebrity' Relations between No 10 and Ms Dorries, a former nurse, have been strained since the prime minister made a joke at her expense in the Commons, describing her as ""frustrated"". He subsequently apologised. Ms Dorries grabbed headlines by describing Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne as ""two arrogant posh boys"" who were out of touch with the real world. Former Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik, who took part in I'm a Celebrity in 2010 after losing his seat, told the BBC the Conservative leadership was ""out of touch with the zeitgeist of the nation"". He added: ""I'm outraged by the fact that it thinks she's been wrong to do something that can put politics in touch with the public."" But former Tory MP Louise Mensch, who recently resigned from the Commons for family reasons and who has had a well-publicised spat with Ms Dorries over her decision, tweeted: ""Nothing sadder than a politician, or ex-politician, on any of those shows."" Labour MP Steve McCabe said: ""David Cameron was too weak to stop Nadine Dorries appearing on a reality TV show. ""But even after dithering over what to do all day, by suspending her he's acted more quickly over an MP who called him an 'arrogant posh boy' than he ever did over a chief whip who swore at a police officer."" In February 2010, Ms Dorries took part in the Channel 4 documentary series Tower Block of Commons, in which MPs moved in with benefit claimants on a deprived council estate. George Galloway, the only other sitting MP to have taken part in a reality game show that took him away from the Commons, when he spent three weeks on Celebrity Big Brother in 2006, also faced criticism that he was neglecting his constituents."
uk-scotland-glasgow-west-20945002,Families hope exhumation will answer Moira Anderson mystery,Three families are hoping the exhumation of a burial plot in North Lanarkshire can lay to rest a 55-year-old mystery over a missing schoolgirl.,"Moira Anderson's relatives believe the 11-year-old was murdered and her body hidden at Old Monkland Cemetery. The family of Sinclair Upton, who was buried there in 1957, have consented to their plot being excavated. For relatives of Alexander Gartshore, the search may confirm whether the child rapist committed another heinous crime. Moira's tortured family have not known what happened to her since she left her family home in Coatbridge on 23 February 1957. The 11-year-old, who was five weeks short of her 12th birthday, was running an errand for her family to a nearby Co-op store when she vanished during a blizzard. She was last seen on board a bus driven by Gartshore, who was jailed later that year for raping a 17-year-old babysitter. Despite decades of appeals, the schoolgirl was never traced. The case remained cold until 1999, when child abuser James Gallogley named his former friend Gartshore as the murderer. Gallogley was said to have made the confession to another inmate while he was dying in Peterhead Prison. Father accused After Gartshore's death in 2006, his daughter Sandra Brown, a former friend of Moira, published a book in which she accused her late father of the schoolgirl's murder. She said she believed Gartshore had initially buried the child's body in a ditch but later moved it to an open grave at Old Monkland Cemetery. Mrs Brown, who later received an OBE for services to child protection and set up the Moira Anderson Foundation, believes her friend's body lies in the burial plot of Sinclair Upton, a former acquaintance of Gartshore. The paedophile is later said to have remarked that Mr Sinclair ""done him a favour"". In 2007, a radar scan of the burial plot found anomalies in the soil that would be consistent with another body being buried there. Mrs Brown and Moira's sister, Janet Hart, who lives in Australia, then launched a petition to get Mr Upton's grave exhumed. The case finally took a decisive turn in 2012 when Scotland's top law officer, Lord Advocate Frank Mulholland, told police to re-open it as a murder inquiry. In December last year, a sheriff granted a request from Moira's relatives to open the grave. With the exhumation now under way, the families of Mr Upton and Gartshore - and above all, that of Moira Anderson - will be hoping for answers."

He was airlifted to Dumfries and Galloway Royal Infirmary with head, back and possible spinal injuries. It is not known at present where in Wales the man is from. The three men were riding the Dalbeattie Forest mountain bike trail, one of the 7stanes centres in south Scotland. The injured man's two friends managed to call the emergency services using their mobile phones, but because of the remoteness of the area the ambulance was unable to get to the scene. Paramedics had to walk to the victim, and he was given pain killing injections as they waited for the Sea King rescue helicopter. A Dumfries and Galloway Police spokesman said: ""The man fell off his mountain bike and suffered head and back injuries. ""Because the ambulance was unable to get to the scene it was decided to call in the rescue helicopter."""
uk-44307037,"What is contempt of court, and why is Tommy Robinson guilty of it?","Former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson has been sentenced to nine months in prison after being found guilty of ""contempt of court"". What does that mean?","By Clive ColemanLegal correspondent, BBC News What is contempt of court? Contempt of court laws exist to ensure people get fair trials. The idea is that juries must not be influenced by anything but the evidence they hear in court. The rules apply to everyone from journalists to people posting comments on social media, and even jurors. If someone interferes with a trial, the defendants can walk free and a new trial might have to be held. The maximum sentence for contempt of court is two years in prison, but it can also be punished with an unlimited fine. The law is set out in the 1981 Contempt of Court Act. Contempt includes publishing anything that creates a substantial risk of seriously prejudicing ""active"" criminal proceedings. Proceedings become ""active"" when a suspect is arrested. Someone could also be in contempt by actions including taking photographs or film, recording what is said in court or talking to a jury member about a case. Why was Tommy Robinson found guilty of contempt? Tommy Robinson, also known as Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, committed contempt of court by broadcasting footage of defendants accused of sexual exploitation. The hour-long broadcast, outside Leeds Crown Court in May 2018, was seen by thousands of people. Lawyers for the Attorney General said reporting restrictions had been put in place. These postponed the publication of any details of the case until the end of a series of linked trials, involving 29 defendants. This was to stop the juries in those cases being influenced. They also said the manner in which Robinson filmed the defendants at court was a problem. The aggressive confrontation could have influenced those on bail not to co-operate with the trial. Judge Dame Victoria Sharp said when explaining the decision, that Mr Robinson encouraged ""vigilante action"" in his Facebook Live. She also said that the video could have ""seriously impeded"" justice over a sexual grooming gang's trial. Robinson was originally jailed for 13 months for the offence in May 2018. But the Court of Appeal said his case hadn't been handled fairly. Then, the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox - the government's top legal adviser - announced that new proceedings could be brought against him. What other famous cases have there been? In 2011, the Sun and the Daily Mail were found guilty of contempt for pictures they published during a murder trial. They had shown the defendant holding a gun, which risked prejudicing the jury. The following year, the Daily Mail and the Daily Mirror were found guilty of contempt, following serial killer Levi Bellfield's conviction for the murder of schoolgirl Milly Dowler. Their articles were part of an ""avalanche"" of bad character information about Bellfield, the hearing was told. The Daily Mirror article detailed his violent treatment and sexual abuse of former partners, including Jo Collings. However, the jury still had to consider its verdict on an attempted abduction charge relating to another victim. The coverage was considered prejudicial and the jury had to be discharged, denying the victim and her family the chance of justice. Bellfield was already in jail for the murders of Amelie Delagrange and Marsha McDonnell and the attempted murder of Kate Sheedy. Does it apply on social media? Yes, discussions about court cases still need to stay inside the jury room. In 2011, in the first case of its kind, juror Joanne Fraill was punished for contacting defendant Jamie Sewart via Facebook - causing a £6m drugs trial to collapse. Fraill was jailed for eight months for contempt for both contacting Sewart and searching online about the case. Sewart had already been cleared but other defendants were still on trial, so proceedings were compromised. Social media users have been warned about commenting on court proceedings, and breaching restrictions put in place. Actress Tina Malone, for example, was given a suspended prison sentence for breaching an injunction protecting the identity of Jon Venables - one of James Bulger's killers. She shared a Facebook message which was said to include an image and Venables' new name. What else counts as contempt of court? Intimidation: Juries must be able to give verdicts without being subject to abuse or intimidation. Carrying out research: In 2012, juror and university lecturer Theodora Dallas was jailed for six months for carrying out her own research about defendant Barry Medlock, who was on trial for causing grievous bodily harm. Taking or posting photos: In 2016, Damian Parker-Stokes was jailed for 15 months for taking photographs in court as his friend Ryan Sheppard was being jailed for murder. Parker-Stokes posted one image on Sheppard's Facebook page with the words: ""Respect g at least u had the balls to admit it ..."" The then Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, said people who used Facebook to ""mock the administration of justice"" and ""cause considerable concern"" to a victim's family, ""must be deterred by the most severe sentences""."
uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-51592312,Officer 'could not avoid' Bedworth mobility scooter crash,"A police officer answering an emergency call ""could not have avoided"" a fatal collision with a mobility scooter, a watchdog found.","Jessie Whitehead was struck by a marked Warwickshire Police car in Bedworth on 23 January 2019. The Independent Office for Police Investigation (IOPC) found the vehicle was travelling at an ""appropriate speed"" for the call. An inquest jury returned a conclusion of misadventure into the death. A narrative, given alongside the verdict following the five-day hearing at Warwickshire Justice Centre, said Ms Whitehead, 74, who had been crossing Coventry Road, ""entered the road carriageway of her own volition, solely in control of her scooter"". Died in hospital ""Several witnesses gave evidence and confirmed that they heard sirens and saw flashing lights from the police car in question,"" it said. Police officers gave first aid at the scene prior to the arrival of paramedics but Ms Whitehead died in hospital, the IOPC said. Its investigation found the police car was travelling at appropriate speed for the response, around 65 mph on the 50 mph limit carriageway before the officer braked, immediately before the collision, on seeing the scooter enter the road. It said the police car had been responding to a report of an oil leak from a broken-down crane on a road near Nuneaton, causing a dangerous hazard at a bend. IOPC regional director, Derrick Campbell, said: ""I again send my sympathies to the family and friends of Jessie Whitehead and everyone affected by this terribly sad event.

uk-26492684,TV licence fee non-payment 'could be decriminalised',"Not paying the TV licence fee could become a civil offence, rather than a criminal one, under plans being considered by ministers.","Culture Secretary Maria Miller said ""decriminalisation of the licence fee should be on the table"" during the BBC's charter review before 2017. The BBC said changing the law could lead to more people failing to pay. In 2012 about 155,000 were convicted and fined for not paying the £145.50 fee. In total 180,000 people were prosecuted for not paying their licence - which is needed to watch or record live broadcasts on any device - accounting for more than one in 10 criminal prosecutions that year. In October 2013 Huffington Post reported that in response to a Freedom of Information Request the Ministry of Justice had revealed that 107 people were jailed between January 2011 and March 2013 for failing to pay fines related to not having a TV licence. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has now told the Daily Telegraph ""serious work"" would be done on the proposal to make non-payment a civil offence and that it could ease the pressure on criminal courts. He said: ""The culture secretary and I both agree that this is a really interesting idea - particularly given the pressure on our courts system. ""Our departments will be doing some serious work on the proposal."" Ms Miller said: ""This is an interesting idea but timing is crucial and decriminalisation of the licence fee should be on the table during charter review, not separate to the process.'' The BBC's current Royal Charter, which expires in 2016, sets out how it should be funded, what it does and how it is managed. A spokesman for the culture secretary added: ""Maria will put decriminalisation of the licence fee on the table during charter review discussions, but to do it before makes no sense. ""She has made clear that the BBC needs to get its house in order, particularly when it comes to governance and transparency, having decriminalisation on the table during the negotiations will focus the BBC's minds."" But Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen is seeking to introduce the change through an amendment to the government's Deregulation Bill. It would make non-payment of the licence fee a civil matter, with a fine for offenders set by the government. He told the Daily Telegraph: ""It is outrageous that so many people are brought in to the criminal justice system through this means. ""I believe that non-payment should be treated in the way that parking tickets are. ""It is absurd that the courts are being clogged up by such a minor offence."" The newspaper reported that the amendment had been backed by 101 cross-party MPs. A BBC spokesman said: ""Legislation is a matter for the government, however changing the law could lead to higher evasion. ""Just a 1% increase in evasion would lead to the loss of around £35m, the equivalent of around 10 BBC local radio stations."""

Both the Pakistani Taliban and the Sunni militant group Islamic State (IS) said they had carried out the attack. Quetta, a city in Baluchistan province that is home to more than half a million Shia Hazara, has witnessed the majority of IS attacks in Pakistan.

It follows scenes of bodies of Greece-bound migrants, including a three-year-old boy, washed up on a Turkish beach.. Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said Northern Ireland ""could take a couple of thousand refugees"" at first. Justin Kouame works for the Northern Ireland Community of Refugees and Asylum Seekers (NICRAS), which currently has about 500 members. ""They come here every day, it's like a sanctuary for them. They will get advice and support,"" he said. ""This humanitarian crisis brings back memories. ""And you know if people come here it will put a lot of pressure on small organisations like NICRAS. We cannot prepare for it, we just have to wait and see what's going to happen next."" He said a lot would depend on the goodwill and generosity of local people. ""People taking boats, some of them don't even know how to swim, but they're risking their lives like we saw yesterday on TV, losing a member of your family or your child,"" he said. ""This is a drastic situation for someone to put themselves into."" Jeffrey Donaldson, DUP, said: """"We have a history in Northern Ireland... one thinks of the Vietnamese boat people or the people from Hong Kong who came and settled. When it comes to refugees, people fleeing religious persecution, we need to make a distinction between that and what are called economic migrants. ""We are talking about people who have been driven from their own country because of religious hatred. We have a tradition of opening our country to such people and we should do it."" Belfast Lord Mayor Arder Carson, Sinn Féin, has called on everyone in the city to show support for people caught up in the refugee crisis engulfing Europe. He urged people to go to a vigil on Monday at the City Hall at 17:00 BST, which, he said, would ""underline the city's reputation for compassion and generosity and willingness to help others"". ""These are real people, it is a humanitarian tragedy, and the untold suffering that they are enduring in the 21st century is almost beyond belief,"" he said. ""We have consulted with the agencies working with the refugees and they have made it clear that it is too difficult logistically to send goods such as blankets, clothes and food, what is really required is money."" On Friday, children from a Londonderry school - St Oliver Plunkett Primary School - sold vegetables from the school garden to raise funds for Syrian refugees. David McNarry, UKIP, said it was important to ask how Northern Ireland would cope with an influx of refugees. ""Are we going to bring people in to give them shelter, heat and food? There is nobody who would say: 'I wouldn't do that',"" he said. ""But are we going to give them permanent residence? Where will the houses come from, where will the jobs come from and where will the school places be found eventually? How will that sit with people who, today, in my country, are looking for a job or they are waiting on a house and they are unable to get their child the school place that they want?"" Sami Ibrahim, who came to Northern Ireland from southern Sudan six years ago, said more people will come from Syria because of the violence there. ""People here, they struggle and the refugees they already struggle, so everyone's going to pay the price, all of us,"" he said. Meanwhile, Irish Justice Minister Frances Fitzgerald said the Republic of Ireland may take in 1,800 refugees."

world-42873633,Reality Check: Where are the world's nuclear weapons?,"The Pentagon has outlined how it wants to revamp the US nuclear arsenal, and develop new low-yield bombs, largely in response to the threat from Russia.","By Reality Check teamBBC News Reality Check looks into where the world's nuclear weapons are located and who owns them. While the global stockpile of nuclear weapons has shrunk significantly since the Cold War, there are hundreds of warheads that could be launched at short notice, and experts say every nuclear-armed nation is modernising its arsenal or has plans to do so. Countries keep most details of their nuclear weapons secret, but it is known that nine countries own the estimated more than 9,000 nuclear weapons that are in military service. These are either deployed - mounted on land or sea missiles and kept at air bases - or in storage. About 1800 are on high alert and could be fired with little warning. The US and Russia own the vast majority of the world's nuclear weapons. Including retired warheads waiting to be dismantled, the total is said to be almost 15,000, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri). This is a marked decline since the 1980s when the figure peaked at around 70,000. Why only these countries? Since 1970, 190 countries including the US, Russia, UK, France and China have joined the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). India, Israel and Pakistan never signed the agreement and North Korea left in 2003. The NPT recognises five states having nuclear weapons - US, Russia, France, UK and China - all of which had tested nuclear weapons before the agreement came into effect. Under the agreement, these countries should not maintain an arsenal forever. The treaty prohibits non-recognised states from developing nuclear weapons. South Africa, and former Soviet Union countries Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine have all given up theirs. Are countries making progress on disarmament? The US, UK and Russia have all been reducing the size of their warhead inventories, Israel's and France's are said to be relatively unchanged and China, Pakistan, India and North Korea are believed to producing more, according to the Federation of American Scientists. But at the very least, experts say, every nuclear-armed state has plans in place to modernise its nuclear stockpile. Modernisation is contrary to the spirit of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, says Shannon Kile, head of Sipri's nuclear project. The UK is planning to replace its fleet of Vanguard nuclear armed submarines, which carries its Trident nuclear missiles. The overall size of its arsenal will be reduced to no more than 180 by the mid-2020s. The US may spend more than $1 trillion (£703bn) by the 2040s upgrading its nuclear capabilities. Some of America's warheads can be found around Europe in Belgium, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, and Turkey, which host around 150 warheads between them. North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test in September and the jury is still out on whether Kim Jong-un's nuclear programme is capable of attaching a warhead to a long-range missile. In recent months, North Korea has demonstrated it has increasingly advanced missiles, which are said to have brought the United States within range. Will there ever be a nuclear-free world? A few months into his presidency, Barack Obama told a crowd of thousands in Prague that under his watch, America would commit ""to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons"". It appeared as though the world edged closer in July 2017 when more than 100 countries endorsed a UN treaty to ban nuclear weapons altogether. So far dozens of countries have signed the legally binding instrument, the first agreement of its kind to explicitly ban nuclear weapons. However the nuclear-armed states boycotted the negotiations. The UK and US say they never intend to join the treaty because it undermines the NPT. Allied Nato countries also failed to acknowledge the new agreement. The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (Ican), the organisation behind the treaty, was awarded the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

health-46865204,"A bit of meat, a lot of veg - the flexitarian diet to feed 10bn","A diet has been developed that promises to save lives, feed 10 billion people and all without causing catastrophic damage to the planet.","By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Scientists have been trying to figure out how we are going to feed billions more people in the decades to come. Their answer - ""the planetary health diet"" - does not completely banish meat and dairy. But it is recommending we get most of our protein from nuts and legumes (such as beans and lentils) instead. Their diet needs an enormous shift in what we pile on to our plates and for us to turn to foods that we barely eat. What changes am I going to have to make? If you eat meat every day then this is the first biggie. For red meat you're looking at a burger a week or a large steak a month and that's your lot. You can still have a couple of portions of fish and the same of chicken a week, but plants are where the rest of your protein will need to come from. The researchers are recommending nuts and a good helping of legumes every day instead. There's also a major push on all fruit and veg, which should make up half of every plate of food we eat. Although there's a cull on ""starchy vegetables"" such as the humble potato or cassava which is widely eaten in Africa. So what is the diet in detail? If you served it all up this is what you would be allowed each day: The diet has room for 31g of sugar and about 50g worth of oils like olive oil. How do your food choices impact on the environment? Don't cry because you can't play with our interactive. Update your browser to have a go! How do your food choices impact on the environment? Your results are below Will it taste awful? Prof Walter Willet, one of the researchers who is based at Harvard, said no and that after a childhood on a farm eating three portions of red meat a day he was now pretty much in line with the planetary health diet. ""There's tremendous variety there,"" he said. ""You can take those foods and put them together in thousands of different ways. We're not talking about a deprivation diet here, it is healthy eating that is flexible and enjoyable."" Is this for real, or just a fantasy? This plan requires changes to diets in pretty much every corner of the world. Europe and North America need to cut back massively on red meat, East Asia needs to cut back on fish, Africa on starchy vegetables. ""Humanity has never attempted to change the food system at this scale and this speed,"" said Line Gordon, director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre, at Stockholm University. ""Whether it's a fantasy or not, a fantasy doesn't have to be bad... it's time to dream of a good world,"" she says. Taxes on red meat are one of the many options the researchers say may be necessary to persuade us to switch diets. Who came up with this? A group of 37 scientists from around the world were brought together as part of the EAT-Lancet commission. They're a mix of experts from farming to climate change to nutrition. They took two years to come up with their findings which have been published in the Lancet. Why do we need a diet for 10 billion people? The world population reached seven billion in 2011 and it's now around 7.7 billion. That figure is expected to reach 10 billion around 2050 and will keep on climbing. Will it save lives? The researchers say the diet will prevent about 11 million people dying each year. That number is largely down to cutting diseases related to unhealthy diets such as heart attacks, strokes and some cancers. These are now the biggest killers in developed countries. How bad is farming for the planet? The use of land for growing food and forestry accounts for around a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. That's about the same as from electricity and heating, and substantially more than from all the trains, planes and automobiles on the planet. When you look more closely at the food sector's environmental impact, you can see that meat and dairy are the major factors. Worldwide, livestock accounts for between 14.5 and 18% of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions. When it comes to other warming gases, agriculture is one of the leading contributors to both methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Agriculture is also a significant source of air pollution with ammonia from farms a major cause of fine particulate matter, which the World Health Organization (WHO) says is a threat to health worldwide. Similarly when it comes to water, agriculture and food productions are one of the biggest threats, consuming 70% of global freshwater sources for irrigation. So will this diet save the planet? The researchers' aim was to feed more people while: However, just changing diets is nowhere near enough. To make the numbers add up, also requires a halving of food waste and an increase in the amount of food produced on current farmland. Why isn't meat being banned? ""If we were just minimising greenhouse gases we'd say everyone be vegan,"" said Prof Willet. However, it was unclear whether a vegan diet was the healthiest option, he said. So what happens now? The EAT-Lancet Commission is going to take its findings to governments around the world and bodies such as the WHO to see if it can begin to change the way we eat. Follow James on Twitter"
uk-northern-ireland-41401080,Belfast-built Tucano touches down for RAF squadron tour,There was a warm welcome home for a pair of Tucano Mark I planes as they roared in over Aldergrove airbase in County Antrim.,"By Mervyn JessBBC News NI The Belfast-built aircraft made the journey to mark the centenary of the Royal Air Force's (RAF) 72 Squadron. Their visit also coincides with the 30th anniversary of the basic trainer's first roll-out at the Shorts factory. The stop is the last one on a centenary tour of airbases that have been home to 72 Squadron over the decades. Flight Lieutenant Chris Nash, who flew one of the Tucanos into Belfast, explained why it is painted in the Battle of Britain colours of the Spitfire, with Enniskillen written on the fuselage. ""It's to do with the way the Spitfires were financed for 72 Squadron during the Second World War,"" he said. ""A war fund was set up at that time and local communities raised money to help build a Spitfire, and that's why they got their name down the side of the aircraft."" The experienced jet pilot explained that he felt a sense of intimidation as a young pilot flying the Tucano, the RAF's basic training plane, for the first time. ""There's more power,"" he said. ""You sit in the front as a student with the staff officer behind you, whereas in previous aircraft it's side by side. ""You're wearing an oxygen mask, you're on an ejection seat and it all starts to feel far more military. ""It's quite challenging to fly but very rewarding once you get used to it and it will continue to be the RAF's basic trainer until 2019."" When the Tucano was first rolled out at Shorts in east Belfast to great fanfare in 1987, the future of thousands of jobs depended on it. But the launch day was not without controversy. Several hundred Shorts workers blocked a road outside the factory in protest at the presence of the then Northern Ireland secretary Tom King over the government's signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Sir Philip Foreman, the Shorts boss at the the time, was not impressed by those who took part in the protest, describing their actions as damaging. ""I'm sure what went on today will be seen around the world and it will certainly damage our business - it puts at risk 7,000 jobs,"" he said. ""But I don't think the people who did this sort of thing really understand the damage they are doing and I can't stress too strongly how irresponsible it is."" In spite of the concerns, the Tucano proved to be a success. The RAF ordered more than 100 of the aircraft, which were built in a joint venture with the Brazilian aerospace company Embraer. Former Shorts test pilot Paddy Crowther has his own memories of that time, particularly of one occasion when his engine cut out while flying over Rathlin Island. ""There is only one engine on the Tucano so it made for an interesting time - we had to divert to Machrihanish near the Mull of Kintyre,"" he explained. ""But apart from that it was very enjoyable to fly - even people like Prince William thought it was good. ""I spoke to his father Prince Charles about it at Hillsborough Castle once and they both thought the Tucano was excellent. ""Compared to other more sedate Shorts aircraft like the Skyvan, 330 and 360 passenger aeroplanes, the Tucano had a little more oomph to it."" Shorts has a history of successfully developing and building aircraft, both civil and military. including the World War Two Stirling bomber. The Tucano is right up there with the best of them."
uk-politics-39499331,PM hints at help for diesel car owners over 'toxin tax',"Diesel car owners could get some help from the government if cities adopt new charges to tackle pollution, Theresa May has suggested.","An ultra low emission zone will come into force in London in April 2019, with a £24 a day fee for some drivers. A so-called ""toxin tax"" of up to £20 a day is also expected to be rolled out to several other UK cities. The government was forced to act by a High Court judge after losing a legal battle with lawyers ClientEarth. It came after the UK got a ""final warning"" on air quality from the European Commission. One road in Brixton, South London, hit its permitted annual pollution level in five days. Owners of diesel cars - who were encouraged by previous governments to buy them as they were thought to be more economical and less harmful in terms of carbon dioxide emissions - have expressed anger and confusion at the move. Former Labour Chancellor Gordon Brown introduced a lower vehicle tax for diesel cars in 2001 - but there has been increasing concern that they emit dangerous levels of nitrogen dioxide, which is thought to cause thousands of premature deaths in the UK. London Mayor Sadiq Khan announced on Tuesday that from April 2019 there would be a £12.50 charge - on top of the existing congestion charge - in central London for petrol cars that do not meet Euro 4 standards and diesel vehicles that do not meet Euro 6 standards. According to City Hall, this will hit most petrol cars more than 13 years old in 2019, and diesel cars more than four years old in 2019. In 2015, former Labour science minister Lord Drayson said Tony Blair's government made a mistake in promoting diesel cars because they were now ""killing people"". Motoring organisations have said diesel car drivers are being ""punished"" for following a previous government's policy. And Mrs May has now hinted there will be schemes to help drivers who were told that diesel vehicles were the right purchase. Speaking on her trip to Jordan and Saudi Arabia, she said: ""Decisions will be taken when we produce that [air quality] plan. ""But I'm very conscious of the fact that past governments have encouraged people to buy diesel cars and we need to take that into account when we look at what we do in the future."" She did not set out any specific plans, but there have been reports of a scrappage scheme that could pay people to get rid of their diesel vehicles."

Taylor told the BBC. ""If it's a hard exit it can drive cost in the system,"" he said. Procter and Gamble and many other companies want ""an amicable solution between the UK and the EU,"" he said. He joins a chorus of business voices trying to put pressure on MPs to come to an agreement, including the British Chambers of Commerce, the Federation of Small Businesses, the Institute of Directors and the Confederation of British Industry. ""What happens is if there's additional money through tariffs or other costs that have been incurred somehow, we'll have to cover those. So we encourage the two parties to work together and find a solution,"" he said. Last month, Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned that food prices could rise between 5% and 10% if there is a disorderly Brexit. Mr Carney told MPs that in the most ""extreme"" case, prices would rise by 10%, but in a less severe scenario the increase would be about 6%. The Bank of England has attempted to assess the impact of Brexit on several occasions. All its assessments have seen it as a potential negative for the economy. In total, 53% of all imports to the UK come from the European Union, it's largest trading partner. The UK imports 30% of its food from the EU."

uk-politics-38628428,Brexit: UK 'could change economic model' if single market access denied,"The UK may be forced to change its ""economic model"" if it is locked out of the single market after Brexit, Chancellor Philip Hammond has said.","Mr Hammond said the government would not ""lie down"" and would ""do whatever we have to do"" to remain competitive. He had been asked by a German newspaper if the UK could become a ""tax haven"" by further lowering corporation tax. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said his comments sounded like ""a recipe for some kind of trade war with Europe"". Having so far refused to offer a ""running commentary"" on her plans, Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to spell out the most detail so far of her Brexit strategy in a speech on Tuesday. Reports have suggested she will signal pulling out of the EU single market and customs union, although Downing Street described this as ""speculation"". In an interview with the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag newspaper, Mr Hammond said he was ""optimistic"" a reciprocal deal on market access could be struck, and that he hoped the UK would ""remain in the mainstream of European economic and social thinking"". ""But if we are forced to be something different, then we will have to become something different,"" he said. ""If we have no access to the European market, if we are closed off, if Britain were to leave the European Union without an agreement on market access, then we could suffer from economic damage at least in the short-term. ""In this case, we could be forced to change our economic model and we will have to change our model to regain competitiveness. And you can be sure we will do whatever we have to do. ""The British people are not going to lie down and say, too bad, we've been wounded. We will change our model, and we will come back, and we will be competitively engaged."" 'Extremely risky' Asked about Mr Hammond's comments during an interview on The Andrew Marr Show Mr Corbyn said ""He appears to be making a sort of threat to EU community saying 'well, if you don't give us exactly what we want, we are going to become this sort of strange entity on shore of Europe where there'll be very low levels of corporate taxation, and designed to undermine the effectiveness or otherwise of industry across Europe.' ""It seems to me a recipe for some kind of trade war with Europe in the future. That really isn't a very sensible way forward."" Mr Corbyn also said Mrs May ""appears to be heading us in the direction of a sort of bargain basement economy"", adding: ""It seems to me an extremely risky strategy."" More like Singapore? by BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam According to Philip Hammond, Britain might be ""forced"" to change its economic model. To what? For some, the true advantage of leaving the EU would be to tear up the 'rules' and make Britain more like Singapore. Singapore abides by World Trade Organisation and ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) trade rules, but it's famed for its light touch regulation - especially when it comes to financial services - which some Brexiteers feel is the opposite of EU ""meddling"". But turning a large G7 economy with a robust social model into a city state might be difficult. It might involve the government handpicking which industries it thinks will be successes and rapidly neglecting existing sectors. Millions of people would need to get brand new qualifications while those with undesirable skills would become surplus to requirements. Massive infrastructure projects might be rushed through with minimal consultation. For a country with Britain's past and present, is that a possible future? Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it appeared Brexit would mean a ""low-tax, deregulated race to the bottom"", with workers' rights and environmental protections threatened. She wrote on Twitter: ""If that is the case, it raises a more fundamental question - not just are we in/out EU, but what kind of country do we want to be?"" In her speech on Tuesday, the prime minister is expected to call on the country to ""put an end to the division"" created by the EU referendum result. She will urge the UK to leave behind words such as ""Leaver and Remainer and all the accompanying insults and unite to make a success of Brexit and build a truly global Britain"". Several of Sunday's newspapers claim Mrs May will outline a ""hard Brexit"" approach, a term used to imply prioritising migration controls over single market access. Northern Ireland Secretary James Brokenshire said he did not think it was a ""binary choice"" between trade and migration, but added that the ""very stark message"" from the EU referendum was that ""free movement as it exists today cannot continue in to the future"". Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics, Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said a ""hard Brexit"" had not been on the ballot paper in June's referendum and accused the PM of adopting ""the Nigel Farage vision"" of Brexit. Mr Farage, the former UKIP leader, told Sky News he had ""yet to be convinced"" by the PM's approach."

This will be the first time pay and pensions are decided independently of Parliament or government. ""This is a huge change from the past,"" Sir Ian said. On the Ipsa website, he asks: ""How much should MPs be paid? ""I'm sure you have a view. We want to hear it."" Ipsa had dealt with the ""mess created by the expenses scandal"", Sir Ian said, with MPs' claims now documented online and rules adhered to. Deciding on MPs' pay and pensions was Ipsa's ""next big challenge"". Democratic heritage The body is hoping to reach a consensus on the experience and skills needed to be an MP, and what MPs' responsibilities are at work. This could help compare MPs' pay with that of similar roles. But it would not be easy, Sir Ian warned, since MPs argued that they all did their jobs differently and being an MP was a ""unique"" profession. Ipsa has decided ""to get as many views as possible"" before reaching any conclusions. ""Of course, the views must be informed rather than a reaction to recent events,"" Sir Ian said. ""We are talking about something very important here: part of the fabric which makes up our democratic heritage. How we remunerate MPs is a statement about the place they have in our society.

Patients, staff and management were interviewed. Ms Hinds will submit her report to the health minister shortly. Speaking to the BBC, she said there needed to be a better management of patients. When asked if some patients are being managed in an environment which is not safe, she said: ""There should be the appropriate number of nurses to look after the patients. ""When admitted to hospital and you are delayed in the system, someone should be appointed to care for you. ""There should be someone responsible for you, for monitoring you, and caring for you."" Ms Hinds refused to comment on the care of the elderly man who died on a hospital trolley at the Royal Victoria Hospital after waiting almost 24 hours for a bed. It was revealed last week that the man had died unnoticed in the accident and emergency department on Tuesday 6 March. However, Ms Hinds clearly laid out what should be in place when a person is admitted to an emergency department. ""It is our responsibility to try and fix it,"" she said. ""Even today I have challenged nurses to try and speak with courage to help fix their services every single day they go into work. ""For the very first time we've now got a commitment from the department to support normal ranges of staffing levels for nursing and that is a first. ""That will ensure safe staffing levels across our trusts in Northern Ireland. Speaking after a speech from Health Minister Edwin Poots to over a hundred nurses, where he outlined his plans to address the A&E crisis, Ms Hinds said he had shown ""great courage"". ""The Minister is showing real leadership,"" she said. ""He is showing that he's making it a priority, he is showing that patients being delayed in A&E is unacceptable. ""I think there is a bringing together of energy and I hope this new action group which has been formed will make the difference. "" After their time spent at the Royal Victoria Hospital's A&E department, it is expected that the team will observe the Ulster Hospital's emergency area in the South Eastern Health Trust."
technology-41928147,Code bug freezes $150m of Ethereum crypto-cash,More than $150m (£115m) of a crypto-currency called Ethereum may have been permanently frozen after a code bug was accidentally triggered.,"The bug was in code written by Parity Technologies to create digital wallets holding virtual coins - called Ether. It let someone hunting for bugs become the joint owner of hundreds of wallets. However, when the unidentified person tried to reverse their mistake they stopped the original owners of the wallets getting access too. Find and fix In a statement, Parity Technologies said all wallets created after 20 July this year were affected by the mistake. It provided a link to a separate page on which Ether holders could check to see if their wallet was among this vulnerable batch. Parity expressed regret over the ""great deal of stress and confusion"" the incident had caused. It added: ""We continue to investigate the situation and are exploring all possible implications and solutions."" It is not yet clear whether Parity will be able to rectify the mistake. This is because the unidentified person who triggered the problem used a function that ""suicided"" code that could have been used to resurrect the wallets. Estimates of exactly how much of Ethereum's coins has been frozen vary widely. Low estimates put the figure at $150m but others suggest it could be as high as $300m. The bug was triggered while an unnamed developer was looking through the Parity code for ways that it could be exploited.

uk-scotland-highlands-islands-26436060,Hushabye mountain: Ski resort may offer sleepovers,A snowsports centre has started looking at the potential of offering overnight accommodation to its visitors.,"Nevis Range and the University of the Highlands and Islands' Centre for Recreation and Tourism have launched a survey to gauge interest in the plan. People have been asked if they would stay in dormitories, chalets or luxury-style accommodation. The survey also asks how much visitors would be willing to pay and how long they would stay. Nevis Range had its busiest day for 10 years on 16 February when almost 1,700 skiers and snowboarders took to the slopes. The resort was not able to operate all of its lifts because some were still buried under unprecedented amounts of snow. Glencoe Mountain, another of Scotland's five outdoor ski centres, already offers holiday accommodation called Hobbit Houses."

Representatives from the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank will take stock of how effective tough austerity measures have been. Fresh strikes are planned by public sector workers in response. 'Struggle' Sunday's talks will decide on the continued conditions for Greece's financial aid, and a 1bn euro (£844m) instalment which Greece expected to get in October. The EU is calling for the liquidation of Greece's defence industry, a further reduction in civil servant posts, and the health of the key privatisation programme. The main public sector union Adedy said that it would carry out a two day strike on Tuesday and Wednesday, while other unions are following suit. ""We will continue our struggle against the destructive policies of the government and the troika,"" Adedy said in a statement. This latest round of protests against austerity comes days after the Greek Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras said his country's economy is heading ""slowly towards recovery"" after it saw growth in the second quarter of the year. Mr Stournaras said available evidence suggested Greece will see quarter-on-quarter growth for the first time since its economic crisis began. Greece also reported slightly improved jobless figures for the summer period, as tourism saw a modest boost compared to the year before."

It had been a 40th birthday present from her husband Dave, and was lost by their daughter. The couple believe the carrot grew through the ring. Ms Keitch said it was a ""chance in a million"" discovery. ""Dave dug up the carrots and left them outside the back door,"" she said. ""I cut the greens off and scrubbed them, and I thought, 'What's that? Goodness, it's my ring'."" She said even though the ring, with an amethyst stone in the centre, was covered in earth she recognised it immediately. ""Dave had bought it for me for my 40th birthday, but when it got too small for me I gave it to our daughter. ""She lost it up the garden - it must be at least 12 years ago.

entertainment-arts-45395322,Chris Evans: A life in broadcasting,Chris Evans has announced he will be leaving the Radio 2 breakfast show at the end of the year to host Virgin Radio's equivalent.,"His departure will bring an end to the latest chapter in an eventful career that has brought him fame, riches - and some notoriety. Evans built his reputation as a witty prankster on London station GLR, where he started as a producer and ended up as a star DJ. He shot to fame in 1992 as host of The Big Breakfast, a riotous early morning programme on Channel 4. The Big Breakfast was a huge hit in its early days, beating even GMTV when it launched on ITV in 1993. The Warrington-born star's dynamic personality defined the show, which catapulted him from cult personality to national celebrity. Don't Forget Your Toothbrush, his first prime-time TV show, made its debut on Channel 4 in 1994. The format for the show - made by Ginger Productions, his own production outfit - was lucratively sold around the world. After leaving The Big Breakfast in 1994, Evans was recruited by BBC Radio 1 to revamp the station's breakfast show. He accepted on the proviso it would be in the hands of Ginger Productions, an arrangement the BBC was prepared to accept in return for bumper ratings. In 1996 he returned to Channel 4 to launch TFI Friday, a classic Evans cocktail of live music, celebrity chat, outlandish stunts and in-jokes. Yet he found it hard to juggle it with his Radio 1 day job, leading to a parting of the ways in January 1997 when his demands to work a four-day week were refused. ""I was stupid, no doubt about that,"" he admitted in 2009. ""I was ungrateful. I had this brilliant career and messed it up."" Evans was not off air for long. Later that year he returned to breakfast radio, on Sir Richard Branson's Virgin station. He liked the job so much he bought Virgin Radio from Sir Richard at the end of 1997. But the Evans magic started to fade soon afterwards. He was photographed out on the town with Paul Gascoigne, damaging the footballer's chances of getting into the England squad for the 1998 World Cup. TFI Friday started to go off the boil, while two BBC projects, the National Lottery-based Red Alert and student quiz Carry On Campus, flopped. That did not stop him selling his Ginger Media Group to the Scottish Media Group (SMG) for £225 million in early 2000. Yet things soon turned sour at Virgin. Evans failed to turn up for a week of breakfast shows and the station ignored his claim that he had been ill. Photographs and footage had emerged of him out drinking with pop star Billie Piper, prompting Virgin to dismiss him. Evans said the termination of his contract cost him £3 million in lost share pay-outs. Yet he ultimately lost his case against his former station. He and Piper married in 2001 and moved to Los Angeles. But their union did not last and they divorced in 2007. Evans would eventually return to the BBC in 2005 to present afternoon shows on Radio 2. After moving to Drivetime in 2006, he was named as Sir Terry Wogan's successor in the coveted breakfast slot in 2009. The following year he moved back to prime-time television by co-presenting BBC One's The One Show on Friday evenings. Evans went on to become one of the BBC's top earners, with figures last year revealing he brought in between £2.2m and £2.25m. This was partly due to him co-hosting BBC One's Top Gear following the departure of Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May. Evans, a well-known petrolhead and experienced broadcaster, was seen as a safe bet to take over the helm of the BBC's flagship motoring show. Yet ratings plummeted, and the presenter was forced to apologise for an ill-advised stunt filmed around a monument to Britain's war dead. Evans left Top Gear after one series, concentrating instead on his Radio 2 show and his two children with third wife Natasha Shishmanian. One of the show's most popular initiatives is 500 Words, a story-writing competition for children now in its eighth year. Earlier this year Evans revealed that he and Natasha, a professional golfer and columnist, were expecting twins. Speculation is mounting over who will replace him now he has chosen to bring the curtain down on his 13 years at Radio 2.

uk-wales-24073302,Archbishop of Wales hopes no one 'lost' over women bishops,"The Archbishop of Wales said he hoped no-one would be ""lost"" from the Church in Wales after its landmark decision to allow women bishops.","Dr Barry Morgan has pledged to talk to those Anglicans who ""find the decision difficult"". The Church's governing body voted overwhelmingly in favour of the change on Thursday. A similar vote in 2008 was narrowly defeated. In England, the issue is due to be discussed again in November. Despite female bishops being allowed in Northern Ireland and Scotland, none have been elected yet. The vote at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David in Lampeter, Ceredigion, led to huge cheers as the result was announced. But it has also led to some traditionalists saying the decision may lead them to consider their future within the Church. Canon Jenny Wigley, Rector of Radyr, whose successful amendment to the bill was instrumental in ensuring the vote had a yes or no outcome, said she hoped women in the Church of England would be encouraged by the result. ""Sisters across Offa's Dyke, look to us,"" she said. 'Promise' The vote leaves the bishops to write a code of practice for those who cannot ""accept the authority of women bishops"". Dr Morgan said: ""I hope it will be possible that no-one will be lost. It's a matter now for discussion. ""I promise on behalf of the bench of bishops that we will talk to a range of people across the Church. ""We'll come back in April to hear what people have to say but in the end the bishops will have to draw up the code of practice."" In the breakdown of the vote, the laity voted 57 for, 14 against, with two abstentions; the clergy section saw 37 voting for and 10 against, while the bishops voted unanimously in favour. Retired Father Alan Rabjohn, a traditionalist and chairman of Credo Cymru (Forward in Faith Wales), said: ""There is still a lot to be dealt with. 'Different world' ""The bishops said they would care for us. That sounds to me like 'we'll look after this lot until they die out'. ""We are not going away. We are here like our brothers and sisters who believe in women bishops,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. ""They have now got to really start talking to people. Not telling us what we need for terminal care but asking us what we need to go on living alongside our brothers and sisters and proclaiming the gospel. One of those who spoke against, Dr Elliott King, said he was still hopeful differences could be overcome. ""Personally I'm disappointed that the bill has passed but we have a great opportunity now over the next 12 months to work together to find a way forward for us all to stay within the Church."" The Venerable Peggy Jackson, Archdeacon of Llandaff, Cardiff, who proposed the amendment with Canon Jenny Wigley, said: ""This morning I wake up in a completely different world."" She said yesterday's vote ""was the day discrimination against women came to an end"" but added that people from both sides of the argument had to live together. ""The important thing is to live together in graciousness and gentleness."""
uk-politics-55973463,"Covid: 'Clean up' awarding of contracts, says Labour","Labour has challenged the government to ""clean up"" how it awards contracts for Covid work.","In an online speech, shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said procurement during the pandemic had been ""rife with conflicts of interest"". And she called for a new ethics watchdog to ""guarantee standards"" for spending public money. The government said it has ""robust rules and processes"" to ensure that conflicts of interest do not occur. During her speech, Ms Reeves raised questions about contracts awarded to companies that she said have links to the Conservatives. She added that ""cronyism in contracting"" had led to ""unforgivable waste"" and showed the need for tougher transparency rules. It comes after a National Audit Office report last November found that more than half of contracts by the end of July 2020 had been awarded without competitive tender. As the pandemic struck last spring, there was a scramble to ensure that hospitals and other care settings had adequate supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE). The NAO found that companies recommended by MPs, peers and ministers' offices were given priority, and not enough was done to address potential conflicts of interest by ministers and other government officials. However, it concluded that in cases of potential conflicts of interest involving ministers, all had properly declared their interests and it found ""no evidence of their involvement in procurement decisions or contract management"". 'Very successful' The prime minister's press secretary Allegra Stratton said: ""We have robust rules in place to make sure there are no conflicts of interest. There are eight checks involved. It is rigorous."" She said procurement ""had to be done at speed, because in early stages of the pandemic we didn't have enough PPE inside the country. ""The government believes that the beginning of the pandemic we had to act very quickly and we were very successful at that."" She added that all public contracts would be published ""in the fullness of time"". 'Shadow state' During her speech, Ms Reeves also called on ministers to end emergency procurement rules brought in at the start of the pandemic, which have streamlined the normal bidding process for contracts. She said ""bad practices"" introduced at the start of the crisis had worsened, with contracts for protective equipment becoming an ""unseemly gold rush"". She urged ministers to publish ""all outstanding contracts"" by the end of the month, and for the Freedom of Information Act to cover all new public service contracts outsourced to private firms. She also criticised in the government's record in recovering money from firms that have failed to deliver services adequately or on time. ""The corporations running so many public services hide behind 'commercial sensitivity'. A shadow state has emerged and it is unaccountable to the people,"" she said. As well as a new Integrity and Ethics Commission, she called for an ""independent anti-corruption and anti-cronyism commissioner"" to oversee how money is spent. She argued these measures would ""clean up government contracting"" and make the UK a ""world leader in good governance""."
uk-england-cumbria-53623102,Coronavirus: Carlisle Wetherspoon pub The William Rufus shut,A Wetherspoon's pub in Carlisle has been temporarily closed after a member of staff tested positive for Covid-19.,"The William Rufus, on Botchergate, shut early on Friday night. Twenty-four staff are now self-isolating. The pub is one of a number in the city where either staff or customers have tested positive for coronavirus in the past few weeks. The chain said it based its decision to close on the availability of staff and its ability to operate safely. Spokesman Eddie Gershon said customer test and trace details had not yet been requested by the authorities but were ""available when needed"". ""Wetherspoon will reopen the pub as and when it can get the number of staff needed to do so safely,"" he said. The member of staff who tested positive was not displaying symptoms but requested a test kit because they were concerned about a local outbreak, the company said. The test was carried out on Monday and the result came back on Thursday. Wetherspoon said the local authority had not advised it to close the pub.

uk-38182298,Child car seats: Will you be affected by rule changes?,New rules on child car seats are set to come into force after March next year and have left many parents confused about what they need to use.,"Changes are being made to the weight and height at which a child will be allowed to use a backless booster seat. However, parents will not need to replace car seats they have already bought because they can continue to use them. What is changing? From next year, changes are being made on the rules regarding backless booster seats. Currently, parents can use these types of seats for children who weigh 15kg (2st 5lbs) and above - typically aged three and over. The new rules will mean only children weighing over 22kg (3st 7lbs) who are also over 125cm (4ft 1ins) tall can use the seats. The United Nations, which sets the safety standards for car seats, has approved the change which must now be implemented by the EU. The government said the earliest the new rules will come in is March 2017 and they will affect the whole of the UK. Why bring in the new rules? Many child car seat experts say they are unsuitable for small children as the child is not held as securely in the seat, the adult seatbelt is not guided across their body in the best way and they offer little protection if a car is involved in a side-on crash. What if you have already bought one? Do not worry. The changes will only apply to new backless seats and not ones already on the market that meet current safety standards. Parents can continue to use their current model after the rule change and will not need to buy a new one. It will be down to manufacturers of new seats to ensure they meet the revised safety standards and are labelled correctly. What is the current law? Children must use a child car seat until they are 12 years old or 135cm (4ft 5in) tall, whichever comes first. There are typically three types of children's car seats: Only EU-approved child car seats can be used in the UK - which have a label showing a capital ""E"" in a circle. Parents should typically choose a car seat based on their child's height or weight. A driver can be fined up to £500 if a child under 14 does not wear a seat belt or child restraint. Anyone 14 and over not wearing a seat belt must pay the fine themselves. There are exceptions. For example, children can travel without a child car seat in a taxi or minicab if they travel on a rear seat and wear an adult seat belt if they are aged three or older or without a seat belt if they are under three. Which seat should you have? Many parents think they can judge which car seat they need to buy based on their child's age but it should only be used as guidance. Car seats are typically categorised according to height and weight. Height-based car seats, known as ""i-Size"" seats, must be rear-facing until the child is over 15 months old. For weight-based car seats, the type depends on how heavy a child is. A more detailed list is available through childcarseats.org.uk"
uk-england-leicestershire-42320938,Birstall house explosion: Woman dies in hospital,A woman has died following a gas explosion at a house in Leicestershire.,"Janet Jasper was taken to hospital following the blast, which happened on Allington Drive, Birstall, at about 07:30 GMT on Monday. Two men were also injured - one is in a stable condition in hospital and the other has been discharged. One house was destroyed, another torn in half and 50 others were damaged. A ""handful"" of families spent Monday night in temporary accommodation. An investigation is under way. Updates on this story and more from across the East Midlands The gas maintenance company Cadent, which supplied the collapsed house in Birstall, has confirmed it attended a call-out on Allington Drive on Sunday. Chris Rison, from Cadent, said: ""We were called and we attended to a job on this street. ""I can't go through the details of that attendance because that's all part of the investigation but it's true that we attended."" The Shah family, who live next door to the demolished house, cannot return home because it is not structurally safe. Local people have offered them shelter, food and hot drinks. Tina Shah said: ""We have had lots of phone calls and messages. The whole community has been fantastic."" Talking about the explosion, she said: ""My son was in bed with me and our roof came in. I didn't know what had happened to my daughter because she was in another room. ""I am just really grateful I have been able to walk out of my house with my two children.""

business-24494888,JP Morgan Chase reports quarterly loss on legal costs,JP Morgan Chase has reported a loss in the third quarter after setting aside $9.2bn (£5.8bn) to cover legal bills.,"The bank lost $380m during the quarter, compared with a profit of $5.7bn in the same period last year. JP Morgan is currently in talks with the US government over a potentially huge settlement relating to the sale of mortgage-related investment products in the run-up to the financial crisis. Last month, it paid $920m to settle charges related to a trading scandal. JP Morgan's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said: ""We continuously evaluate our legal reserves, but in this highly charged and unpredictable environment, with escalating demands and penalties from multiple government agencies, we thought it was prudent to significantly strengthen them."" He stressed that the bank's underlying business was strong. Stripping out one-off charges, the bank made $5.8bn over the three months to the end of September. Wells Fargo, the biggest US mortgage lender, also reported results on Friday. It reported a record net income of $5.3bn in the third quarter, up 13% on the same period in 2012. That rise came despite a fall in income at its mortgage business, where revenue fell 43% to $1.6bn. The fall was offset by lower expenses and a reduction in funds set aside for loans going bad. Legal trouble JP Morgan now has a contingency fund of $23bn to cover legal expenses. It also said that it could face litigation-related expenses of another $6.8bn. It is currently in talks with the Justice Department over a potentially huge settlement, related to the mis-selling of mortgage related products during the US housing boom. It is thought the settlement could cost as much as $11bn. Mr Dimon stressed on Friday that much of the case related to deals done by Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, companies that JP Morgan Chase bought during the financial crisis. ""The Board continues to seek a fair and reasonable settlement with the government on mortgage-related issues and one that recognises the extraordinary circumstances of the Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual transactions, which were undertaken at the request or encouragement of the US government,"" he said. Last month, JP Morgan paid $920m to settle a case related to disastrous trades by Bruno Iksil, who earned the nickname the ""London Whale"" for his big bets on the financial markets. Last year, the bank admitted to losses of $6.2bn resulting from his activities. As part of the settlement deal, JP Morgan admitted violating US federal securities laws."
world-middle-east-55949391,Israel's Netanyahu enters plea in court in corruption trial,Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied corruption charges in court for the first time as his trial resumes in Jerusalem.,"Mr Netanyahu entered his plea at the hearing which had been previously postponed because of the pandemic. He is the first serving Israeli prime minister to go on trial, which takes place just a month before elections. Mr Netanyahu, 71, is accused of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three separate cases. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the district courthouse ahead of the prime minister's brief appearance on Monday morning, making noise, waving banners and calling for him to resign. Mr Netanyahu had urged supporters not to come to court because of the threat of coronavirus. The prime minister arrived for the hearing wearing a black protective mask. Inside the courtroom he rose to reject the charges, before departing within 45 minutes while his lawyers continued deliberations. What is Benjamin Netanyahu accused of? Mr Netanyahu has been indicted in three cases, known as 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000: Mr Netanyahu has consistently denied all the charges against him, branding them a ""witch-hunt"" by political opponents, and has vowed to clear his name. How can the PM serve and stand trial at the same time? According to Israeli law, a leader charged with a crime is not required to resign. But there is no precedent. A former prime minister, Ehud Olmert, stepped down as party leader when he was under investigation for corruption in 2008 but technically remained prime minister until elections the following year - polls which brought Benjamin Netanyahu to power. What does the trial mean for the country? In short, a serving prime minister occupying the most powerful office in the land simultaneously trying to clear his name and avoid jail-time. It comes just six weeks before Israelis go to the polls in what is expected to be a close-fought election. While Mr Netanyahu's own Likud party has stood behind him, political opponents have tried to maximise the prime minister's legal difficulties, claiming he is unfit to hold office. Mr Netanyahu has though previously successfully fought three elections since criminal investigations into him began in 2016. Even if he is convicted and is still in power, Mr Netanyahu will not be required to resign unless and until any appeals are exhausted - which could, in theory, be many months or years into the future. In Ehud Olmert's case, the former prime minister went on trial in 2009 and after he was convicted only began serving his sentence in 2016 due to the long legal process."

They plan to use some of the land to create cheap parking for up to 100 cars to boost High Street traders. They also hope to develop a community shop on the site to promote local goods and produce. Cymdeithas Cynnal a Cefnogi Cefn Gwlad, which translates as the Society to Sustain and Support the Rural Countryside, is aiming to issue 900 shares at £500 each. It says the price of the vacant site is likely to be just over £300,000. Town councillor Shan Williams, who is behind the idea, said: ""The idea is to support the High Street and not be in competition with it. ""Hopefully the people of Cardigan and the surrounding area will support us."" She said the priority was to create car parking for up to 100 vehicles to make it easier for shoppers to visit High Street. Phase two involves opening a community shop to showcase locally made goods and produce. The not-for-profit consortium has the backing of the town's chamber of commerce and local assembly member Elin Jones. She said: ""This site is a really important site in the centre of Cardigan and it is in need of development and putting back into active economic use."""
uk-england-nottinghamshire-52442967,Coronavirus: Man jailed for attacking police querying journey,A man has been jailed for four years for attacking three police officers and a police dog after being asked if his train journey was essential.,"Nelson Nelson, 28, dragged one of the officers in front of a bus and hit the dog several times with a plank of wood with a nail in it. He was challenged at Nottingham railway station on 4 April after travelling there from his Birmingham home. Two of the police officers needed hospital treatment. Sentencing Nelson at Nottingham Crown Court, Judge Gregory Dickinson told him his actions had put further strain on the NHS and police. ""This country is tackling a most serious epidemic. Every one of us, every member of the community, has a part to play,"" he said. Nelson, from Broadfield Walk, Ladywood, pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to two counts of assault, two counts of actual bodily harm, possession of an offensive weapon, possession of a knife, and causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal. The court heard Nelson was approached by two British Transport Police (BTP) officers at the station and ""took exception to them asking if his journey was essential"", becoming abusive. He punched both officers, knocking the male one down against a wall and the female one to the ground. The male officer chased after Nelson, who dragged him into the road in front of an oncoming bus. Officers from Nottinghamshire Police then arrived and Nelson charged at one and punched him, despite being Tasered. Nelson then attacked police dog Quantum, kicking it several times and repeatedly striking it to the head with the plank of wood. The dog eventually knocked him to the ground and he was arrested. The male BTP officer suffered ligament damage to his jaw and thumb, and bruising and swelling across his body. His female colleague had severe concussion and bruising to her face. In mitigation, Nelson's barrister said he had been in Nottingham visiting an ill friend and became frustrated because he did not understand how he could get home without getting a train.

magazine-24378937,The generation dependent on the phone charger,"The European Parliament is voting on whether to have a single charger for all phones. Shorter battery lives mean many are prisoners to their chargers, notes Harry Low.","Magazine MonitorA collection of cultural artefacts It's a common sight. We see people plugging in at airports, on trains and in the office. Charging hubs have been springing up at festivals and in eastern European capital cities. One landlady in Norwich has even had her television unplugged by a pesky patron. The hot spell in London and the south east of England last summer saw a significant rise in sales of portable chargers for mobile phones. They even made it into court when one of those jailed for looting during the London riots was found to have been delivering a phone charger to a friend. In some ways, shorter battery life is pushing us to revert to our pre-mobile phone ways where we agreed in advance to meet at a set time and place. Jeff Parsons, news editor at technology magazine T3, says the charger provides a temporary solution to a problem which manufacturers have been unable to solve. ""These new devices run even more processes and have newer features that in turn use up valuable power. A bright display, push notifications and Bluetooth connectivity are some of the biggest power drains on a modern smartphone. ""In fact, when used to their full potential, few smartphones are able to last longer than 24 hours without a recharge. Ultimately, no-one wants to be left with a dead phone at a crucial time so it's hardly surprising that many people choose to play it safe and bring a phone charger with them when they travel."" The option of a plug socket, or ""power point"", is now marketed by train companies when booking tickets for a long-distance journey. But our insatiable thirst for electricity for our gadgets has also thrown up questions of its own. Should you plug in at work? How much does this cost businesses each year? Is it acceptable to sit next to a public plug socket and not use it, thereby stopping someone else? So next time you sit down in a cafe, be wary of your choice of seat - somebody wanting power may well be watching with envy. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook"
entertainment-arts-21687612,Sam Mendes 'won't direct' next Bond,"Sam Mendes, director of the latest Bond film Skyfall, has revealed that he will not direct the next in the series.","He told Empire Magazine it was a ""very difficult decision"". The director, who is currently working on a stage production of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, says his current work needs his ""complete focus over the next year and beyond"". But he added he had not ruled out the possibility of returning to the 007 franchise in the future. ""I feel very honoured to have been part of the Bond family"", said Mendes, ""and very much hope I have a chance to work with them again."" The Oscar-winning director picked up the outstanding British film award, for Bond's 23rd outing, alongside producers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli at this year's Baftas. ""It has been a very difficult decision not to accept Michael and Barbara's very generous offer to direct the next Bond movie,"" explained Mendes. ""Directing Skyfall was one of the best experiences of my professional life."" There had been doubts about whether the director would make a second Bond film after he described Skyfall as ""completely exhausting"". ""I felt like everything I wanted to do with a Bond movie, I put into this film,"" he was quoted as saying last year. Wilson and Broccoli said in a statement that they hope to work with the director again in the future, adding they ""completely respect his decision to focus on other projects"". Screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, who have worked on five instalments of the series, have also revealed they are quitting the franchise. Speaking during an appearance at the fourth Doha Tribeca Film Festival in November 2012, Wade said that screenwriter John Logan had been working with Mendes on a follow-up to Skyfall. Speaking to the BBC News website this week, Logan said the script was ""coming together very well"" but would not be drawn into revealing any details. Skyfall became the highest-grossing movie in UK box office history in December. To date, the film has earned £102.8m in the UK and Ireland."
uk-wales-55581949,Covid: Wales' schools and colleges shut until half term unless cases fall,"Schools and colleges in Wales will stay closed to most pupils until the February half term unless there is a ""significant"" fall in Covid cases.","First Minister Mark Drakeford also confirmed current lockdown restrictions would be extended and ""strengthened"". This means non-essential retail, hospitality venues, licensed premises and leisure facilities remain closed and showrooms must now shut as well. Mr Drakeford said: ""The pandemic has reached a significant point."" He told BBC Radio Wales the announcement was the ""best certainty"" he could offer parents, pupils and teachers, ""in a world which is highly uncertain and where things change almost every single day"". The phased return to face-to-face learning at some Welsh universities has also been postponed, while internal GCSE, A-level and AS-level assessments have been cancelled. The announcement follows a similar move in England, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already said schools would not open before half term. Spring half term in Wales is scheduled to take place the week beginning Monday 15 February. Wales has been in an alert level four lockdown since 20 December in an attempt to reduce the transmission of coronavirus. On Thursday, 63 further deaths from coronavirus were reported by Public Health Wales. Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, Mr Drakeford said the new variant was more easily spread and stricter lockdown measures were now needed to keep people safe. Ministers are in talks with employers and unions and changes are set to be announced for workplaces - to protect workers - early next week. Mr Drakeford said he wanted to see the way supermarkets were policed return to the way they were during the first lockdown, with strict number limits in stores and social distancing measures abided to. But he said a curfew, meaning people would have to be in their homes by a certain time, similar to that seen in Northern Ireland, was not currently being considered. Schools and colleges had already been told they would have to teach online until 18 January at the earliest, however this will now continue if cases of the virus do not fall ""materially"" before the next review date on 29 January. If cases do not drop, that would mean schools would reopen on 22 February at the earliest, and internal exams have also been cancelled. But teaching unions have warned that more uniformed lateral flow testing needs to be in place and teachers must be vaccinated before talks on how to reopen schools can begin. Speaking at the Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said people working at special schools and school and college staff who were at risk would soon be vaccinated. Cardiff University has also confirmed that a phased return to in-person teaching has been cancelled, with learning continuing online for most students until 22 February. Students currently have to have had two lateral flow tests confirming they are negative for Covid-19 before they return to Welsh campuses - and face to face teaching is only resuming for medical students and those who have practical parts of their courses on campus. Mr Drakeford said: ""Universities have worked hard to make sure that when students do return it is done in a careful and controlled way, with the safety of those young people and their communities at the forefront of their planning."" The announcement affecting showrooms means any retailers which allow people to browse and then order for a future date - such as kitchens, bathrooms, furniture and car sales - must close. Click and collect will still be allowed. Confirming alert level four restrictions would continue for at least three more weeks, Mr Drakeford told Radio Wales the lockdown measures were already leading to cases falling, but the rate remained high. ""There are some positive signs that the huge collective effort we are making is making a difference, but the numbers are stubbornly high,"" he said. ""We have not yet seen an impact of those falls feeding into the number of people being admitted to hospital and becoming, sometimes, so ill they need intensive care. ""We need to see the numbers come down as well so that our NHS is genuinely able to cope with the enormous pressure it is currently facing."" Mr Drakeford said huge efforts were being made to rollout the Covid-19 vaccines, and with the ""end being in sight"" it was more important than ever for people to follow the rules and stay home. ""We have made so many sacrifices together and we mustn't stop now,"" he said. What is happening with schools? Education Minister Kirsty Williams said: ""Schools and colleges have been safe and secure environments throughout the pandemic and that continues to be the case. ""However, the latest TAC report is clear on education's contribution. We know that school and college settings can contribute to wider social mixing outside the education environment and, right now, we all have to play our part in supressing this virus."" Ms Williams said the government would use the period until the next review date to ""look at all the possibilities for a phased and safe return of some pupils, such as those studying for qualifications, or the youngest children who find distance learning the most difficult"". Following the announcement, exams regulator Qualifications Wales cancelled the spring ""internal assessment window"" for GCSE, AS and A-level pupils, which was scheduled for 22 February - 23 April. This was introduced following the decision that exams would be cancelled in 2021. Chief executive Philip Blaker said: ""We know that learners need clarity about how they will be assessed and there will be clarity on revised arrangements soon."" Mr Drakeford said discussions were under way between teachers and education officials over ways children could catch up after missing time in school. Police 'will continue to crack down on rule breakers' Speaking at Friday's Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said police and local authorities would continue to crack down on people who break lockdown rules. Since the start of the pandemic, 3,585 fines have been handed out by police forces in Wales. ""Of course I want to thank everyone for following the rules and helping to keep Wales safe. It's always frustrating when a small minority act as though those rules do not apply to them,"" he added. ""I want everybody to know that where people knowingly and persistently break the rules, action will be taken. Too many lives have been lost to this awful virus to allow anybody to believe that they do not share in the responsibility that binds us all."" What's the reaction been to the school announcement? Unions welcomed the news saying the health and safety of pupils and staff ""had to be a priority"", but said teachers must now be given the vaccine as a priority, and pupils and staff must be protected before talks about reopening schools began. Currently teachers are not on the priority list for immunisation, and have to wait to get the jab dependent on their age and if they have a medical condition. Laura Doel, director of The National Association of Headteachers Cymru, said a ""properly organised"" testing regime needed to be put in place for schools, and special schools and pupil referral units needed support to remain open. ""Any plan that sees school staff return to face-to-face learning should be afforded as much protection as possible against the virus,"" she said.""Once these issues have been addressed, then we can discuss the orderly return to school we all want."" Meanwhile, Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru said: ""I think we would be happier if we had clarity about what that date looks like, it would give confidence in the system."" What do opposition parties say? Opposition parties called for clear plans on how schools would return and for support to make sure pupils from poorer backgrounds did not fall behind due to a ""digital divide"". Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said: ""The Welsh Government must plan now for the gradual and safe reopening of schools, putting in place safety measures, and should lay out plans for a vaccination programme for schools staff."" Welsh Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies called for the Welsh Government to publish evidence on its reasons for closing schools, bring forward vaccines for teachers, and that money must be made available for all pupils to access laptops for online learning. ""This is another bleak day for education in Wales,"" she said. ""Decisions aren't easy to make and I urge everyone involved in the journeys to and from school to consider how they might help schools open again and stay open."" She tweeted: ""Get a grip on consistent online quality. Give my vaccination to a younger teacher."""
uk-england-lancashire-24775178,Police to probe Lancashire County Council's finances,Police are to investigate allegations of financial irregularity at Lancashire County Council.,"The authority has referred the conduct of a senior officer who was the focus of a recent disciplinary investigation to police after taking legal advice. It is currently probing the tendering process of a £5m fleet contract and the authorisation of a £500,000 payment to a senior officer. Suspended chief executive Phil Halsall left the authority on 24 October. 'Concerns over irregularities' A Lancashire County Council (LCC) spokesman said: ""In the light of external legal advice, a number of issues arising from the recent disciplinary investigation into the conduct of a senior officer have now been referred to Lancashire Constabulary. ""The council will not be commenting further at this time."" Det Ch Supt Clive Tattum said: ""The Constabulary has received a referral from Lancashire County Council which outlines concerns in relation to a number of financial irregularities. ""We are at the very early stages of investigations into these matters and so it would be inappropriate to comment any further for the moment."" Mr Halsall left the authority by ""mutual consent"". He has denied any wrongdoing and his supporters believe the complaints are politically motivated. He had been suspended on full pay in August pending the outcome of a disciplinary investigation into the tendering of the fleet vehicle contract. The deal to run the council's fleet services was agreed in April by the former Conservative administration which was led by Geoff Driver. It was awarded to BT but the decision was called in by county councillors and put on hold. The council's in-house provider continued to provide the services. The contract was revoked on 15 August with immediate effect by current LCC leader Labour councillor Jennifer Mein. It was awarded to BT and One Connect Ltd, a partnership between BT and the council. LCC is also conducting a separate investigation into the authorisation of the payment of more than £500,000 to David McElhinney who resigned in August. He received two separate payments that Ms Mein and the council treasurer said they were unaware of. Mr McElhinney ran One Connect Ltd, which was contracted to run various council services. Jo Turton is continuing as the interim chief executive and a decision on who will take over the role permanently will be made in due course, the authority said."
business-36356022,Bayer's Monsanto bid to create biggest agricultural supplier,"German drugs giant Bayer has made a $62bn (£43bn) offer for Monsanto, in a deal that would create the world's biggest agricultural supplier.","Bayer said the bid was an ""extraordinary opportunity to create a global agriculture leader."" Monsanto is primarily known for genetically modified crops, often leading to vocal activist criticism. Last week, news of the deal angered Bayer investors, with one describing it as ""arrogant empire-building"". The offer marks the biggest ever bid by a German company, dwarfing the Daimler's $38.6bn acquisition of Chrysler in 1998. John Colley, a Professor of Practice at Warwick Business School, said it was an unusual approach for a German firm, which he said typically opted for lower risk expansion. ""The Bayer bid is clearly designed to leave the board of Monsanto with little room for manoeuvre. The large cash bid means - despite Monsanto's dislike of European ownership - they will appear as though self interest is prevailing if they reject it. ""Few megabids go well and research shows more than half destroy value, and only around a quarter deliver on their promises,"" he said. Bayer's farm business produces seeds as well as compounds to kill weeds, bugs and fungus, but it is better known for its healthcare products such as Asprin and Alka-Seltzer. Analysts said if the deal went through, almost half of the merged firms' business would be agriculture, a mix likely to displease investors who had bought shares in Bayer for its pharmaceutical offering. Bayer's shares, which fell 8% when the merger talks were announced last week, fell 3% in early trading. The offer comes amid a wave of mergers in the industry. 'Perfect match' Rivals Dow Chemical, DuPont and Syngenta have all announced tie-ups recently, although they have yet to be cleared by regulators. The drop in commodity prices has put pressure on firms such as Monsanto, with farmers' cutting orders for supplies. Bayer said the offer of $122 per share represented a 37% premium on the price of Monsanto shares before rumours about the takeover bid emerged in the media. ""Monsanto is a perfect match to our agricultural business. We would combine complementary skills with minimal geographic overlap. ""At the same time, ongoing consolidation activities in the industry make this combination by far the most attractive one,"" Bayer's chief executive Werner Baumann said in a statement. He said he was confident that the Monsanto board would accept the offer, saying ""we fully expect a positive answer"". Both companies had confirmed last week that they were in talks over a possible deal. Industry mergers Bayer has a market value of about $90bn, making it the second-largest producer of crop chemicals after Syngenta. Monsanto, which has a market capitalisation of $42bn, attempted to buy Swiss rival Syngenta last year. However, Syngenta ended up accepting a $43bn offer from ChemChina in February, although that deal is still being reviewed by regulators in the US. After the unsuccessful bid, Monsanto announced plans to cut 3,600 jobs by the end of next year in a massive restructuring. Bayer's acquisition of Monsanto is expected to be bigger in value than the ChemChina-Syngenta deal. The biggest merger in the chemicals industry took place late last year when Dow Chemical teamed up with Du Pont to form a new $130bn company."
uk-scotland-31554251,Fracking moratorium 'should be extended' to underground coal gasification,Anti-fracking groups have called on the Scottish government to extend its moratorium on the development of unconventional gas.,"They want it to include underground coal gasification (UCG), a technique used to produce gas from coal seams deep underground. The groups claimed it was the most ""experimental and frightening method"". The Scottish government said it was taking a ""careful, considered and evidence-based approach"". It also said many powers relating to UCG were reserved to Westminster. The Scottish government announced in January that it was imposing a moratorium on granting consents for shale gas and coalbed methane developments in Scotland while further research and a public consultation was carried out. Firth of Forth The moratorium did not include underground coal gasification, which campaigners have claimed raises similar environmental and public health concerns to shale gas and coalbed methane techniques. Supporters of UCG argue that it is a way of providing cleaner energy, diversity of supply and energy security for the UK. There are already plans to exploit remaining coal reserves deep beneath the Firth of Forth and the Solway. Energy company Cluff Natural Resources has estimated there are up to 335 million tonnes of coal under the seabed of the Forth alone. It wants to build the UK's first deep offshore UCG plant to exploit the coal seams. In a robust response to the anti-fracking groups, Cluff said there had been more than 100 UCG projects worldwide since the technology was first demonstrated in the 1930s, and that, when done properly, ""there are no inherent risks associated with the process or the technologies employed in UCG"". Andrew Nunn, the group's chief operating officer, added: ""Typically, the ill-informed opponents of UCG choose to focus on a small number of negative outcomes during the developmental phases of the technology rather than the opportunities that a well-designed and operated UCG project could bring to the people of Scotland in the form of more competitive local industry, new employment opportunities, local tax revenue and energy security. ""These increasingly extreme groups oppose practically all forms of energy development in Scotland and do not represent the vast majority of the population. ""They have no democratic legitimacy and should not be allowed to dictate government policy, which works to the benefit of the entire nation. ""The misleading and increasingly inflammatory language they use is deliberately designed to instil an unwarranted sense of fear and unease in communities for their own political ends, which is a great disservice to those they claim to represent."" But the anti-fracking groups have written to Energy Minister Fergus Ewing calling for him to halt the UCG industry in its tracks. The letter has been signed by organisations including Friends of the Earth, the Unison union and the Women's Environmental Network, as well as a number of community anti-fracking groups and academics. It expressed their ""grave concern"" that UCG is not currently covered by the scope of the Scottish government's moratorium. And it said Scottish ministers already had sufficient powers to impose a moratorium on UCG. The letter said: ""While we are disappointed that Coal Authority licensing is not proposed to be devolved to Holyrood under the Smith Commission, we note that the means of imposing a moratorium on unconventional oil and gas developments - ensuring that no planning permissions or environmental permits are granted for these developments - could equally be applied to underground coal gasification."" Mary Church, head of Campaigns at Friends of the Earth Scotland, claimed UCG was the ""most experimental and frightening method of unconventional gas extraction currently threatening Scottish communities."" She also said recent trials around the world had gone ""badly wrong"", and described the climate impact of the technology as ""simply unacceptable"". ""It makes no sense for a country with ambitious climate targets and the means to achieve them with renewables to flirt with such a risky form of energy production."" she added. ""Communities threatened with Cluff's plans to ignite the coal under the Forth are asking why hasn't the Scottish government acted to protect them in the way that communities facing shale gas fracking and coal bed methane drilling are. ""The case to include underground coal gasification in the new moratorium and planned work on health and environmental impacts of unconventional gas is crystal clear, and the means of doing so totally within the power of the Scottish government."" 'Appropriate controls' In response, the Scottish government said its ""careful, considered and evidence-based approach"" had been underpinned by the recent moratorium announcement, which outlined its plans for a full public consultation and further research. A spokesman said: ""The moratorium is specifically about onshore unconventional oil and gas developments, including fracking - further to confirmation by the UK government that it would devolve onshore licensing powers for these types of development. ""Many of the relevant powers relating to underground coal gasification remain with Westminster and the licensing regime is not being devolved, though we will work with Sepa and all relevant regulators to ensure we have the appropriate controls and regulations to protect the environment. ""The Scottish government will continue to take an evidence-based approach to the development of new energy technologies, which should give security and confidence to the people of Scotland that such resources would be developed in an environmentally safe and satisfactory way."""
uk-scotland-glasgow-west-36292970,Steamer TS Queen Mary returns to the Clyde,A 1930s steam ship that gave its name to the ocean liner Queen Mary has returned to the Clyde.,"TS Queen Mary, one of the oldest Clyde-built steamers, arrived at Greenock on Sunday afternoon after being towed from the Port of Tilbury in Essex. The 250ft ship has been languishing at the docks for years after falling into disrepair. A charity backed by Robbie Coltrane is raising funds to restore the ship and berth her permanently in Glasgow. Friends of TS Queen Mary has raised enough money to make her seaworthy but a further £2m will be needed to complete the restoration. The group hopes eventually to give her a permanent berth near the Finnieston Crane as an entertainment venue and education centre. History of a steam ship Built in 1933 at Dumbarton, The TS Queen Mary was one of the last steamships to be launched from the famous Clyde dockyards. She sailed passengers 'doon the watter' from Glasgow to destinations such as Dunoon, Rothesay, Millport and Arran. At the outbreak of World War Two, the steamer - known as TS Queen Mary II at the time - became a lifeline for Scotland's island communities. While other vessels were commandeered to sweep for mines or to protect Scotland's skies from German bombers, she helped maintain a vital passenger and freight service between the mainland and the islands. As cars became more affordable and British holiday habits changed, she was eventually retired in 1977 and spent several years as a floating restaurant. In 2008 she was sold to a private owner but plans to restore her failed and she fell into disrepair."
uk-scotland-19823466,Scottish universities drop in Times Higher Education world rankings,Scottish universities have slipped down an annual list of the world's top 200 institutions.,"Edinburgh was the only Scottish institution to improve its standing in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings. But Glasgow, Aberdeen, St Andrews and Dundee all saw their ratings drop dramatically. The editor of the ratings warned UK universities were in danger of falling behind Asian rivals. The California Institute of Technology retained the top spot in the survey - with Oxford University coming in second. The UK was the second best represented country overall in the rankings, and three English universities were in the top ten. But while the University of Edinburgh climbed from 36th to 32nd, Glasgow University fell 37 places to 139th, while Aberdeen dropped 25 places to joint 176th. St Andrews went from 85th to 108th, and Dundee fell out of the top 200 altogether. A spokesman for the University of Dundee said: ""While we are disappointed with the drop in our overall position in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, it is important to look at the context. ""Dundee actually recorded a slightly higher overall score than last year, according to the metrics used in the table. This includes higher scores for teaching, international outlook, and research."" Education Secretary Mike Russell said: ""Scottish universities are well known around the world for the quality of education they offer. ""We have invested significant funding in our universities to ensure they can continue to offer a world-class degree and compete internationally. ""We will continue to deliver access to university based on the ability to learn, not the ability to pay, and this year more students will be studying at our world-class universities - unlike universities in England where, overall, the number of acceptances has fallen."" 'Privately concerned' However, Scottish Labour MSP Hugh Henry said: ""Despite generous settlements for universities paid for with money from Scotland's hard-pressed colleges, this clearly shows that Scottish universities are facing major challenges both within the UK and internationally. ""Many universities are privately concerned about how their funding will be sustained in the future. ""We need an open and honest debate about how Scotland's universities can compete internationally whilst properly funding Scotland's colleges."" While the US and the UK still dominated the ratings, significant gains were made by their top Asian competitors. The editor of the survey, Phil Baty, said uncertainty in education in England could see world-class universities collapse into global mediocrity. He added that while Scotland was better protected by current policies, those were unlikely to be enough to meet the challenge posed by massive spending in Asia. 'Brutally competitive' Mr Baty told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""We have to look at ways to ensure that in times of austerity we're getting money into our universities. ""I actually think the tuition fees that have been tripled in England aren't enough to cover the gaps in funding in other areas like research. Scotland's done well to protect higher education funding but it's not really enough."" Alastair Sim, director at Universities Scotland, said having four Scottish universities in the world's top 200 was a ""recognition of the strength of Scotland's higher education sector"". He said: ""It is clear that the value of a Scottish higher education stands up to international comparison. ""However, Scotland's universities are competing in a brutally competitive global marketplace. It will take the continued commitment of energy, initiative and investment if we want to compete with the increasingly powerful top Asia-Pacific universities and the best of Europe and America. ""We are ambitious for a Scottish higher education sector truly excellent in world terms, not just truly excellent when compared to the rest of the UK."" The Times Higher Education World University Rankings employ 13 separate performance indicators, which it says makes it the only world rankings to examine all the core missions of the modern global university - research, teaching, knowledge transfer and international activity."
technology-41036781,Why does no-one want a new phone these days?,"""My iPhone 6S is falling apart,"" says 18-year-old student Asher Silver.","By Mary-Ann RussonBusiness Reporter, BBC News ""But I think the iPhone 7 is useless - you can't plug in a speaker when you play music and you can't charge it [at the same time]."" He's not alone. Earlier on Thursday Dixons Carphone said the appetite for new phones was pretty weak currently - one reason worried investors marked the shares down by about a fifth. Dixons Carphone said customers are choosing to hang on to their existing smartphones for four to five months longer, and it is partly because Apple's most recent iPhone is not seen as appealing enough. iPhone 7 apathy ""For half the market, the Apple base more or less rejected the iPhone 7,"" said Dixons Carphone chief executive Seb James. ""We have a much bigger iPhone 6 base - we have many customers holding on to the iPhone 6S even if the battery is on its last leg."" I'm an Apple fan myself, and I'm in the same boat as Mr Silver. I love my iPhone 6S, and while Tim Cook might think Apple had ""courage"" when it decided to remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, I - like many others - disagree. I've had my iPhone 6S for almost two years, and I still love it. I'm eligible for an upgrade on contract, but why would I want one, when the phone I have now is just fine? But even those whose phone is on its last legs still won't upgrade to the iPhone 7. Asher Silver's phone has a hole in its corner, but he would rather just get another iPhone 6S. Growing concern Even those on the iPhone 5 - launched half a decade ago - are not in a great rush to upgrade. Copywriter Kate Fairman, 26, says it's too expensive: ""I've had my iPhone 6S for two months. Before that I had an iPhone 5S. I kept it for a long time because I couldn't afford a new phone and I had to wait to get an upgrade."" Dixons says price is a growing concern and people are not upgrading their phones as frequently because the handsets themselves have risen in price. Although investors in Dixons Carphone were clearly spooked by the poor picture painted of mobile phone sales, chief executive Mr James is optimistic that the number of mobile phone contract packages will soon go up, because no phone will last forever, and few people want to pay the full price of a smartphone upfront. Of course, the depreciation of the pound hasn't helped matters either, as the iPhone is priced in dollars, and the pound buys fewer dollars than it did before the Brexit vote. That currency effect has also pushed up the cost of Samsung in the UK. Windsor Holden, head of forecasting and consultancy at Juniper Research, says: ""People are hanging on to their phones for longer."" ""There's also been a slight increase in prices of high-end handsets. That will in turn have an impact on affordability."" End of cool? In 2015 when the iPhone 6S was launched, there was a mad rush for gold and rose gold iPhones among the Instagram set, as the device was considered to be the ""must have"" accessory of the season. Although the iPhone is still popular with core Apple fans, overall, the pop culture prestige of owning a smartphone is starting to die out, according to experts. ""If you take a developed market with a high penetration of iPhones, the coolness factor has gone down, because everyone already has a premium smartphone, compared to four or five years ago,"" says Roberta Cozza, a research director at Gartner. ""Overall, the sense of smartphones being a fashion accessory has diminished. ""Lifecycles have extended on smartphones. It's harder to sell a premium flagship device because users will not buy unless they see a meaningful difference to their daily experience."""

It will be attended by eight heads of state. The police have written to people living near the airport to inform them about the huge security operation. The summit has been organised by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and will be attended by the heads of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States. In a letter to residents in the vicinity of the airport, Chief Superintendent Henry Irvine said the leaders would be accompanied by sizeable delegations. ""Naturally, the increase in visitor numbers will result in some disruption to the transport network,"" he said. ""People travelling on 16, 17 and 18 June 2013 will be advised to leave extra time for their journey. ""Previous G8 conferences have also attracted a number of protest groups. Police will be planning for this eventuality and this may again result in some disruption to the transport network. ""As a result there will be a highly visible police presence across parts of the Antrim Borough throughout the duration of the G8 conference."" The police said that there would be a large security presence on all routes around the airport. There will also be a ""larger than normal police and security presence"" within Belfast International Airport itself in the days leading up to the arrival of the delegates. In a statement, the PSNI added: ""This is necessary and unavoidable. However, local residents can be assured that police will be putting in place arrangements for access to homes and agricultural land on an individual basis for those who will be directly affected. ""These people will be contacted directly in due course."" The increased security measures will also affect traffic around Antrim, Crumlin, Templepatrick and Killead. Vehicle checks will be carried out and anyone living, visiting or working in the area. The PSNI has also launched G8 Facebook and Twitter sites to provide the most up-to-date information. A number of public meetings will be held over the coming weeks and months to keep people up to date about the situation. Security in a wide area surrounding the hotel where the summit is being held has also been increased in recent weeks with police patrols, vehicle checkpoints and security barriers. Last month, a device containing 60kg of explosives was found 16 miles away from the Lough Erne golf resort. It was later defused."

Irish-born Miss Gowing, from New Brighton, Flintshire, has not been seen since a sighting at a supermarket last Friday. Mr Sharp was remanded to appear at Caernarfon Crown Court on Tuesday. The defendant, dressed in a blue top and dark trousers, said nothing during the one minute hearing apart from confirming his name and age. There was no application for bail. Miss Gowing was last seen leaving an Asda supermarket at Queensferry, Flintshire, on 12 October. It is alleged Mr Sharp murdered her in a period up to 17 October. On Friday, North Wales Police confirmed a burnt out car found close to a disused quarry near her home was hers. Divers and police also searched a pool in the quarry on Saturday. Miss Gowing is originally from County Offaly in the Republic of Ireland. Det Ins Iestyn Davies later read a statement on her family's behalf which said: ""Our primary concern and objective is to find Catherine. ""The support that we have received from the police, the public and all Catherine's friends is keeping us going and will continue to do so. We will bring Catherine home.""

A $100m (£70m) research programme to develop the computer chip-sized ""starships"" was launched by the billionaire Yuri Milner, supported by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg. Interstellar travel has long been a dream for many, but significant technological hurdles remain. But Prof Hawking told BBC News that fantasy could be realised sooner than we might think. ""If we are to survive as a species we must ultimately spread out to the stars,"" he said. ""Astronomers believe that there is a reasonable chance of an Earth-like planet orbiting one of the stars [in] the Alpha Centauri system. But we will know more in the next two decades from ground based and space based telescopes. ""Technological developments in the last two decades and the future make it possible in principle within a generation."" Prof Hawking is backing a project by Mr Milner's Breakthrough Foundation, a private organisation funding scientific research initiatives that government funders think to be too ambitious. Expert group The organisation has brought together an expert group of scientists to assess whether it might be possible to develop spaceships capable of travelling to another star within a generation and sending information back. The nearest star system is 40 trillion km (25 trillion miles) away. Using current technology it would take about 30,000 years to get there. The expert group concluded that with a little more research and development it might be possible to develop spacecraft that could cut that journey time to just 30 years. ""I'd have said that even a few years ago travel to another star at that kind of speed would not be possible,"" said Dr Pete Worden, who is leading the project. He is chairman of the Breakthrough Prize Foundation and a former director of Nasa's Ames Research Center in California. ""But the expert group figured out that because of developments in technology there appears to be a concept that appears to work."" The concept is to reduce the size of the spacecraft to about the size of a chip used in electronic devices. The idea is to launch a thousand of these mini-spacecraft into the Earth's orbit. Each would have a solar sail. This is like a sail on a boat - but it is pushed along by light rather than the wind. A giant laser on Earth would give each one a powerful push, sending them on their way to reaching 20% of the speed of light. It sounds like science fiction but Yuri Milner, who was named after Yuri Gagarin by his parents, believes that it is technically possible to develop these spacecraft and get to another star within our lifetimes. ""The human story is one of great leaps,"" he said. ""Fifty-five years ago today, Yuri Gagarin became the first human in space. Today, we are preparing for the next great leap - to the stars."" Challenging work There are many problems to be overcome before the first spaceships capable of going to other stars are built. These include miniaturising cameras, instruments and sensors so they fit on a chip, developing a solar sail strong enough to be blasted by a powerful laser for several minutes and find a way to get pictures and information of the new star system back to Earth. Prof Sir Martin Sweeting, who is a researcher at the Surrey Space Centre and head of Surrey Satellite Technology in Guildford, wants to be involved in the project. He founded a company 30 years ago that reduced the size and cost of satellites. ""A lot of what we did in the 1980s was considered very wacky but now small satellites are considered all the fashion. This (project to go to another star) is currently a wacky sounding idea but technologies have moved on and now it is not wacky it's just difficult,"" he told BBC News. Prof Andrew Coates of the Mullard Space Science Laboratory, which is part of University CollegeLondon, agreed that the project would be challenging, but not impossible. ""There would be significant difficulties to solve such as ruggedisation for the space radiation and dust environment, instrument sensitivity, interaction of the high power accelerating laser with the Earth's atmosphere, spacecraft stabilisation and power provision. ""But it is a concept worth looking at to see if we could really reach another star system within a human lifetime."" But Prof Hawking believes that what was once a distant dream can and must become a reality within 30 years. ""There are no greater heights to aspire to than the stars. It is unwise to keep all our eggs in one fragile basket,"" he told BBC News. ""Life on Earth faces dangers from astronomical events like asteroids or supernovas"". Follow Pallab on Twitter"

world-52015486,Coronavirus: Why some countries wear face masks and others don't,"Step outside your door without a face mask in Hong Kong, Seoul or Tokyo, and you may well get a disapproving look.","By Tessa WongBBC News, Singapore In recent weeks, many European nations have issued advisories to wear a mask in certain public settings, and in England the latest advice is to wear a face covering in ""enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible"", such as public transport and some shops. Several US states have also given similar advice, and even the White House now makes it compulsory for all staff to wear face masks - though President Donald Trump still refuses to wear one. Many people are still not wearing masks despite official advice though, and some governments remain unconvinced about the science. Why some people embrace masks while others shun them is not just about government directives and medical advice - it's also about culture and history, a debate over evidence, and even about personal liberties. The official word on face masks Since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, the official advice from the World Health Organization has been that only two types of people should wear masks: those who are sick and show symptoms, and those who are caring for people who are suspected to have the coronavirus. Nobody else needs to wear a mask, and experts have given several reasons for that. One is that a mask is not seen as reliable protection as other methods, given that current research shows the virus is spread by droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces. So it could protect you, but only in certain situations such as when you're in close quarters with others where someone infected might sneeze or cough near your face. This is why experts say frequent hand washing with soap and water is far more effective. Removing a mask requires special attention to avoid hand contamination, and it could also breed a false sense of security where you end up ignoring or forgetting to practice good hygiene. Yet in some parts of Asia everyone wears a mask by default - it is seen as safer and more considerate. In mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Taiwan, the broad assumption is that anyone could be a carrier of the virus, even healthy people. So in the spirit of solidarity, you need to protect others from yourself. Some places take this idea very seriously: in some parts of China, you could be arrested or punished for not wearing a mask. In Singapore, which used to discourage citizens from wearing masks, it's now compulsory to wear one outside or risk a fine of S$300 (£170, $210). Meanwhile in Indonesia and the Philippines, where there are suspicions that there are many under-reported cases, most people in major cities wear masks to protect themselves from others. For many of these countries, mask-wearing was a cultural norm even before the coronavirus outbreak. They've even become fashion statements - at one point Hello Kitty face masks were all the rage in the street markets of Hong Kong. In East Asia, many people are used to wearing masks when they are sick or when it's hay fever season, because it's considered impolite to be sneezing or coughing openly. The 2003 Sars virus outbreak, which affected several countries in the region, also drove home the importance of wearing masks, particularly in Hong Kong, where many died as a result of the virus. So one key difference between these societies and Western ones, is that they have experienced contagion before - and the memories are still fresh and painful. In some parts of Asia, seasonal air pollution or heavy traffic pollution in crowded cities have also made it pretty normal for people to wear masks outside. The mask as a social nudge Some argue that ubiquitous mask wearing, as a very visual reminder of the dangers of the virus, could actually act as a ""behavioural nudge"" to you and others for overall better personal hygiene. ""Putting on a mask every day before you go out is like a ritual, like putting on a uniform, and in ritual behaviour you feel you have to live up to what the uniform stands for, which is more hygienic behaviour like not touching your face or avoiding crowded places and social distancing,"" said Donald Low, a behavioural economist and professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Then, there's the idea that every little bit counts in the war the world is waging against the virus. ""We can't say if face masks are ineffective, but we presume they have some effect because that's the protection we give to healthcare workers,"" said Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiologist with Hong Kong University. ""If face masks are used on a lot of people in crowded areas, I think it would have some effect on public transmission, and at the moment we're looking for every small measure we can to reduce transmission - it adds up."" But there are down sides of course. Some places such as Japan, Indonesia and Thailand have faced shortages, and South Korea has had to ration out surgical masks. There is the fear that people may end up re-using disposable masks, which is unhygienic, or use inferior masks sold on the black market. Japan and Singapore have since given out reusable masks to its citizens. People who do not wear masks in these places have also been stigmatised, to the point that they are shunned and blocked from shops and buildings. In Hong Kong, some tabloids have splashed pictures on their covers of Westerners not wearing masks and congregating in groups in the city's nightlife district, and criticised expatriates and tourists for not taking enough precautions. But the discrimination works both ways. In places where mask wearing is still not the norm despite government advisories, those who do wear masks have been shunned or even attacked. It hasn't helped that many of these mask wearers are Asians. In the US, it's become an issue of personal freedoms, with some arguing that making everyone wear face masks infringes on civil liberties. The city of Stillwater in Oklahoma was forced to soften a mask law to an advisory after threats of violence, while a Michigan security guard was killed after he barred a shopper who didn't have a mask from entering a store. But those societies that do advocate everyone wearing a mask may have a point and increasingly, experts are now questioning the official WHO advice. Undocumented cases Firstly, there is some emerging evidence that there are more ""silent carriers"", or healthy people with the virus who show little or no symptoms, than experts initially thought. In China, it is estimated that a third of all positive cases show no symptoms, according to classified Chinese government data seen by the South China Morning Post. On the Diamond Princess, the cruise ship that docked in Yokohama, about half of the more than 600 positive cases found onboard were found to have no symptoms. A similar proportion of asymptomatic cases has been reported in Iceland. The prevailing belief has been that because these people do not exhibit symptoms, they are not very contagious. But some are questioning this now. A recently published study of cases in China found that ""undocumented cases of infection"", or those with either mild or no symptoms, were significantly contagious and could have been responsible for nearly 80% of positive virus cases. Meanwhile a Hong Kong study estimates that up to 44% of virus transmission from an infected person can happen before that person starts showing any symptoms. So does that mean if everyone wore a mask, these silent carriers wouldn't turn into spreaders? The jury is still out on this issue, with various studies proving and disproving the effectiveness of a mask in stopping transmission of the coronavirus. This is why some places have so far held back from mask laws and advisories, such as New Zealand which successfully controlled its outbreak and is holding back on advising citizens to wear masks because of the lack of scientific consensus and clinical trials. Research is ongoing, and future studies will no doubt add nuance to the overall picture. The face mask may be a product of recent history, experience with contagion, and cultural norm. But as this pandemic evolves, along with evidence and research, our behaviour may change again. Additional reporting by Helier Cheung"
uk-wales-46544534,Rare Slavonian grebe spotted in Welsh nature reserve,An endangered bird has been spotted making a rare visit to Wales.,"The Slavonian grebe was spotted at a nature reserve in the coastal resort town of Rhyl, Denbighshire. The bird is ""red-listed"" by the RSPB - the highest conservation priority, meaning that urgent action is needed due to a declining population. Only 30 breeding pairs of the grebe species remain in the UK, and all are found in Scotland. Sightings in north Wales are rare. Tony Thomas, lead member environment at Denbighshire council, said: ""It is fantastic to see a rare bird like the Slavonian grebe make a home here in Denbighshire."" The Brickfield Pond location chosen by the bird has been transformed from a derelict site by the council over the last two decades, turning it into an oasis for wildlife with reed beds attracting insects that make the perfect food for the grebe. The council said it has been monitoring the grebe, and keeping in contact with the pond's regular birdwatchers. During the summer the Slavonian grebe has yellow ear tufts, but in the winter the bird is purely black and white. Between October and March they can be found around the UK coast, most notably in Scotland and Sussex."
world-europe-14514916,Germany marks 50 years since Berlin Wall,"Germany is marking 50 years since the building of the Berlin Wall when the communist East closed its border, dividing the city for 28 years.","Berlin Mayor Klaus Wowereit told a ceremony on Bernauer Street: ""The Wall is history but we must not forget it."" President Christian Wulff said Germany had been securely established as a reunified country. The city observed a minute's silence at noon (10:00 GMT) in memory of those who died trying to escape. Soldiers from the East began construction on the morning of 13 August 1961. The BBC's Stephen Evans in Berlin says the East German authorities portrayed the Wall as a barrier to keep the fascist West out - what came to be known as the Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart. But he says the accepted view now is that it was to keep East German potential migrants in. 'Saddest day' Addressing the ceremony on Bernauer Street, famously divided by the Wall and now site of a memorial, Mayor Wowereit said the capital was remembering the ""saddest day in its recent history"". ""It is our common responsibility to keep alive the memories and pass them on to the next generation, to maintain freedom and democracy and to do everything so that such injustices may never happen again,"" he said. At a ceremony at a former crossing-point, President Wulff said the wall had been ""an expression of fear"" of those who created it. ""The world situation, of which this wall was a symbol, seemed irreversible to many people,"" he said. ""But this was not the case. In the end, freedom is unconquerable. No wall can survive the will for freedom in the long term. The violence of just a few has no hold over the drive for freedom of many."" Chancellor Angela Merkel, who also attended the event, was herself raised in the East. The number of people who died trying to cross the Wall is disputed - at least 136 are known to have been killed but victims' groups say the true number is more than 700. The first victim was thought to be Guenter Litfin on 24 August 1961 and the last Chris Gueffroy on 6 February 1989. A list of names of the victims was read out overnight. Although the Wall came down in 1989, it remains for some a symbol of continuing economic division between the richer west and poorer east. Invisible barrier Brigitta Heinrich, a schoolteacher by profession, grew up in Klein-Glienicke, which was unusual in that it was an East German enclave on the territory of West Berlin. Speaking to Russian news agency Ria-Novosti, she said one of her own pupils had escaped across the Wall in the early days, using a ladder. The schoolboy's parents were forced to move out of Klein-Glienicke as a result, and the mother was sacked from her job in a company, she said. Recalling the hardships and broken illusions of the communist state, Ms Heinrich, who still lives in the East, also talked of the difficulty of readjusting to a unified country. She said she had made friends with other Europeans such as Italians and Finns since the fall of the Wall but some West Germans, especially in regions further away from Berlin, seemed indifferent to people from the former East, as if an invisible barrier remained. ""I cannot name a single West German with whom I socialise now - really, I can't,"" she said. Few parts of the Wall remain, though city authorities have laid down an 8km (five-mile)row of cobblestones to mark its path. Tourists often struggle to find original sections."
technology-47001458,Thousands tell HMRC to delete voice data,"More than 160,000 people have told HM Revenue and Customs to delete biometric data it gathered during phone calls.","The tax authority captured millions of callers' voice data after launching its Voice ID system in 2017, but originally gave people no easy way to opt out. Privacy group Big Brother Watch said people had been ""railroaded into a mass ID scheme by the back door"". HMRC now lets people opt out or decline Voice ID and delete captured ""voiceprints"". But it has kept millions of Voice ID records in a database held by a third party. Big Brother Watch said the tax authority had ""created one of the largest known state-held voice databases in the world"". About 7 million people are currently enrolled in the database, which lets taxpayers use their voice instead of a password when calling the helpline. A Freedom of Information request revealed that 162,185 people had ""opted out"" and had their voice data deleted by December 2018. Prior to that, people had to get in touch with HMRC separately and ask to be removed from the Voice ID system. About 80 people did so. Big Brother Watch said it had reported HMRC to the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), suggesting it had broken data protection law. ""It is down to the ICO to take robust action and show that the government isn't above the law,"" Big Brother Watch said in a statement. An HMRC spokesman said: ""Our Voice ID system is very popular with millions of customers as it gives a quick route to access accounts by phone. ""All our data is stored securely and customers can opt out of Voice ID or delete their records any time they want."" The organisation is cooperating with the ICO, which is investigating to see whether the system breached data protection law."
entertainment-arts-43681521,George Formby treasure trove found in a disused office cabinet,"An archive of letters, diaries and photos belonging to film star George Formby and his spouses has been found in a disused office in Preston.","By Ian YoungsArts & entertainment reporter Formby was one of the biggest stars of the 1930s and '40s, and the collection was found in a battered suitcase in a cabinet by an office clearance firm. It includes diaries and passports belonging to his wife Beryl Ingham and fiancee Pat Howson. Scott Felton, who found it, said he was ""amazed"" when he came across the items. ""It was an old office,"" he said. ""It looked like they'd just upped and left and everything was still there, and we purchased the whole contents. ""That's what we do for a job, so we're used to this - but never finding anything like that. ""You never really find anything that's of any value because people tend to take it out, so this is like a little treasure trove."" Formby, known for his chirpy comic persona and ukulele tunes, starred in some of the most popular films of the '30s and '40s and was reputedly the best-paid entertainer in Britain. He was married to Beryl from 1924 until her death in 1960. Less than two months later, Formby caused a stir when he got engaged to Pat, the 36-year-old daughter of a family friend. The couple planned to marry the following year, but Formby died from a heart attack in Preston at the age of 56 before they could do so. The newly-discovered collection includes Pat's diaries covering nine years. The entry for Monday 6 March 1961 has written in the corner: ""4.00pm George RIP."" The entry for that Friday says simply: ""George's funeral."" An estimated 100,000-150,000 people lined the streets of Liverpool to pay their respects when his funeral was held. The suitcase also contains a mounted letter dating from 1939, relaying how members of the royal family had been ""completely convulsed with laughter"" while watching Formby's films including It's in the Air. There are both Beryl and Pat's passports, photos and negatives of George and Pat together, and of George on film sets, and photos of Beryl as a child, when she was a champion clogdancer. After he died, Formby's estate was at the centre of a court battle between Pat - who was the main beneficiary of his will - and the star's mother and three sisters. Caroline Stewart, chairwoman of the George Formby Society, said of the find: ""Anything that's got a direct link to George is exciting. ""Also, the little period after Beryl's death when George and Pat Howson got engaged - there's not a lot known about that because it was such a brief period, so there's a bit of insight there."" In June 1961, Pat sold the contents of George and Beryl's house in a three-day auction held in a marquee in the grounds. Virtually everything was sold - even his underpants. Referring to the possessions in the suitcase, Ms Stewart said: ""They must have come from the house - they must have been saved from the sale."" George and Beryl didn't have any children, and Pat was childless when she died in 1971 at the age of 46. Mr Felton is now hoping to sell the collection.

Protests on Saturday - sparked by the death of George Floyd - were largely peaceful, but were marred later by disturbances outside Downing Street. One demonstrator, who was not at Downing Street, saw officers ""acting very aggressively"" elsewhere. Further demonstrations are taking place across the UK including in Bristol, where the statue of a prominent slave trader has been pulled down. In a statement Dame Cressida, the UK's most senior officer, thanked officers at Saturday's protests in London for their ""extreme patience and professionalism"". ""I am deeply saddened and depressed that a minority of protesters became violent towards officers in central London yesterday evening,"" she said. ""This led to 14 officers being injured, in addition to 13 hurt in earlier protests this week. ""We have made a number of arrests and justice will follow. I know many who were seeking to make their voices heard will be as appalled as I am by those scenes. ""I would urge protesters to please find another way to make your views heard which does not involve coming out on the streets of London, risking yourself, your families and officers as we continue to face [the deadly coronavirus]."" The majority of Saturday's protests were peaceful but in the evening there were disturbances outside Downing Street. BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds said the protest was largely over when missiles and fireworks were thrown at a police line. Two officers were seriously injured, including a Mounted Branch officer who was knocked from her horse when it hit a set of traffic lights whilst appearing to bolt. She suffered a broken collarbone, a broken rib, and punctured lung, according to the Metropolitan Police Federation The officer had struggled to stay in control as she was riding down the street surrounded by protesters. She remains in hospital in a stable condition after undergoing surgery. But Asia Ahmed, an activist who attended several of the protests, said ""these situations don't come from nowhere"". She told the BBC she had seen the police ""acting very aggressively"" towards protesters. Ms Ahmed, who was not at Downing Street during the disturbance, said a ""lot of people"" she spoke to ""feared for their lives when they saw police horses"". ""I don't think that was the best tactic to use if you're trying to create a peaceful environment,"" she said. Police arrested 29 protesters for variety of offences, including violent disorder, public order offences and assault on emergency service workers. The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said the pockets of violence were ""simply not acceptable"". He said: ""I stand with you and share your anger and pain. George Floyd's brutal killing must lead to immediate and lasting change in countries, cities, police services and institutions everywhere. ""But this vital cause was badly let down by a tiny minority who turned violent and threw glass bottles and lit flares, endangering other protestors and injuring police officers.""

science-environment-13754423,Asteroid Vesta comes into focus,The Dawn spacecraft is starting to get an eye-full of the Vesta asteroid.,"By Jonathan AmosScience correspondent, BBC News The probe expects to reach the 530km-wide body in late July, whereupon it will go into orbit around the rock. Vesta is what scientists term a protoplanet - a body that never acquired the proportions of ""grown-up"" planets such as Earth and Mars. It is nonetheless an impressive object - the second most massive asteroid in the belt of rocky debris that orbits between Mars and Jupiter. Nasa's (US space agency) Dawn satellite will be spending about 12 months at Vesta before moving on to Ceres which, at 950km in diameter, is by far the largest and most massive body in the asteroid belt. The new images released on Monday are a big improvement on the dot-like navigation shots released last month that were used to fine-tune the probe's approach to the rock. The latest pictures were acquired on 1 June, from a distance of about 480,000km. Vesta's irregular form is now unmistakeable. In the images, one pixel corresponds to 45km on Vesta's surface. In the days since 1 June, Vesta has started to acquire pictures with resolutions of around 30km per pixel - slightly better than the best shots we have from the Hubble Space Telescope. ""This is really a new world which we've never seen before, so it should be very exciting,"" said Dr Andreas Nathues from the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research (MPS) in Germany which processed the imagery. ""We will have five times Hubble resolution by the beginning of July,"" he told BBC News. The asteroid has the look of a punctured football, the result of a colossal collision sometime in its past that ripped a big chunk out of its south polar region (the five o'clock position). The debris from that smash-up was sent far and wide. About one in every 20 meteorites that falls on the surface of the Earth is probably a bit of Vesta. Ceres and Vesta will make for interesting subjects. They are both evolved bodies - objects that have heated up and started to separate into distinct layers. In the case of Vesta, telescopes have spied evidence for the eruption of lava (basalt) on its surface. ""The goal is to acquire the first colour pictures of Vesta in early July,"" said Dr Nathues. ""We will go into three different kinds of orbits and the last of these will be about 200km in height from the surface. The best resolution at that stage will be about 20m per pixel.""

The fire service said it did not know the identity of the fraudster, though emphasised it was a third party and not one of its employees. Details of exactly what was bought using the card is not known because the fire service had overwritten the transactions in its own database with ""fraudulent"". It is unclear whether Barclaycard has or will refer the matter to the police. Purchase cards are used by various fire service departments to pay for items ranging from conference tickets to binoculars. 'Eligible' for refund In February, when the service fell victim to fraudsters, the total amount spent on the various departmental cards was £23,069. The card used by the fraudsters was the one used by the service’s purchasing and supply department. The spokeswoman said because the fraud was committed by a third party - and not a member of fire service staff - no internal action was taken. The BBC has not been able to establish whether either the fire service or Barclaycard know the identity of the suspected fraudster. A spokeswoman for Barclaycard said: “As soon as a client informs us that their card has been used fraudulently, we will act swiftly to block the card to prevent any further losses, and undertake a full investigation to understand what happened. “In the vast majority of genuine fraud cases, the customer is eligible for a full refund.

""In particular, post-match celebrations and a lack of social distancing at certain events have proved disappointing and problematic,"" it added. 'Disappointed and angry' Health Minister Robin Swann said he was ""disappointed and angry"" at the scenes of spectators appearing to breach Covid-19 regulations at the game. He told the assembly he welcomed that the GAA had now suspended all its games, but that he was concerned about the impact the event could have. ""I was angry to see it because if there's one person in that group or community who has Covid-19 there is all chance it has spread among that group,"" he said. ""I note the GAA have suspended all games and they've expressed disappointment - they're claiming circumstances were beyond their control but I would have liked to see more stringent adherence to the guidance that was already in place."" The minister also said that if there were further breaches, he would ""encourage the police to investigate"". 'Show leadership' The game between Slaughtneil and Magherafelt was moved from Londonderry's Celtic Park to Bellaghy, in the Mid-Ulster Council area, after stricter Covid-19 restrictions were introduced in the Derry and Strabane Council area. Derry GAA said it moved the game as it did not want spectators entering the city given the high rate of Covid-19 cases. ""It was an all-ticket event with restricted numbers and advice on GAA and health protocols were, including social distancing, widely communicated in the lead-up to and during the game,"" the organisation said. It added that it had taken the decision to ""play an intermediate final and junior semi-final fixtures at the weekend behind closed doors as there were teams from the Derry City and Strabane Council playing in each of the games"". Gary Middleton, a Foyle MLA, called on the GAA to ""step up and show leadership"" and noted his own constituency had rising case numbers. He called on the police to investigate. DUP MLA Keith Buchanan, who represents the Mid-Ulster area, told BBC News NI's Inside Politics programme that several members of the community in Bellaghy had sent him images of the crowd at the game. He said he was not raising it as a political issue but one of personal responsibility and added that others would pay the price for the behaviour of the crowd, which he described as ""out of control"". Sinn Féin's Linda Dillon told the programme that she had not seen the images but that if regulations have been broken then it should be looked at. However, she paid tribute to the role local GAA clubs had played during the pandemic. She said she was sure the GAA would look at the scenes from the weekend and take a responsible attitude. SDLP MLA Patsy McGlone also said he had not seen the images but that if there had been any braches then the Public Health Agency (PHA) should liaise with the GAA and investigate. In a statement, Mid Ulster Council said it ""would emphasise the need for everyone to behave responsibly"". A spokeswoman for the council said that ""enforcement responsibility lies with the PSNI"", and had previously called for people to follow guidance after Covid-19 guidelines appeared to be breached at a match involving Dungannon Clarkes. Police have said they are investigating a GAA match in County Tyrone on Sunday 20 September to see whether Covid-19 regulations were breached. Following the match, crowds came onto the pitch, leading to concerns about social distancing. The council added it called on everyone to adhere to ""the regulations and guidelines which are there to protect us all, especially as cases are rising"". What are the rules about fans in a stadium? Sporting events are omitted from rules that limit outdoor gatherings to 15 people, and some spectators are allowed - but within strict restrictions. Under guidelines issues by the Department for Communities, spectators are required to be two metres apart.. A crowd management plan should be in place too, with a one-way system to avoid congestion as spectators enter and leave a stadium. Where possible, ticketing and booking should be used, to allow for social distancing within seated venues. A specific maximum number of spectators allowed is not given by the department. Inside Politics Mid Ulster Q&A will be available to watch on the BBC News NI website from Monday evening and is broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster at 06:00 on Tuesday,"

uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-52807928,Coronavirus: People urged to cook for their neighbours during lockdown,A Scottish entrepreneur wants to encourage people to cook food for others in their community during the lockdown.,"By Angie BrownBBC Scotland News Donnie Maclean, from Fife, said he had developed Virtual Community Kitchen to help provide home-cooked meals to the elderly and vulnerable. Live programmes on Zoom will teach people how to make nutritious meals with affordable ingredients. Mr Maclean said the aim was to ""bring back a sense of community"". ""The lockdown may be lifting, but people are still going hungry and are still vulnerable,"" he said. ""There are lots of food parcels being delivered by wonderful charities and social businesses. ""However, having something freshly cooked or baked for you brings more joy than tinned food."" Mr Maclean, who is on the board of Scotland Food and Drink, said he wanted to help people while his own business, Eat Balanced, was on hold. He is encouraging people to leave notes for their elderly or vulnerable neighbours, asking if they want a hot meal cooked for them. Those taking part can then sign up for the weekly programmes, which cost between £1 and £5, with proceeds going to homelessness charity Cyrenians. Mr Maclean, who is originally from Glasgow, said it was a way of ""empowering people to feed their neighbourhood, especially the elderly and vulnerable"". The chefs involved in the programme will include Lucinda Bruce-Gardyne, the founder of Genius Gluten Free, and Edinburgh-based Sicilian chef Lucia Ortisi. Mr Maclean said the venture would also feature musicians, storytellers and singers as they have been struggling to find work during the lockdown."
world-middle-east-37638256,Yemen conflict: The UK's delicate balancing act,"Appalled by the carnage of last Saturday's double bombing of a Yemeni funeral, Britain is sending its Minister for the Middle East on a sensitive mission to Riyadh.","By Frank GardnerBBC security correspondent The explosions killed at least 140 people, mostly civilians, and injured over 500. More than four days on since the attack - which was widely reported to have been an air strike by the Saudi-led coalition - the Saudi authorities have yet to publicly accept responsibility. The UK, which has a long-standing and lucrative defence and trade relationship with Saudi Arabia, has taken the unusual step of requesting ""oversight"" of the ongoing investigation into the attack. Will this be enough to dampen the growing condemnation of US and British military support for the Saudi campaign? Unlikely. Tobias Ellwood MP, the Foreign Office minister for the Middle East and the man who has to periodically stand up in Parliament to defend Britain's arms sales to the Saudis, is due to hold sensitive talks with Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Adel Jubair as well as the Yemeni president and the UN Special Envoy for Yemen. At stake is more than just an explanation of how such a horrific death toll was incurred in a single attack at the weekend. For the UK, this is also about the whole nature and rationale of its controversial strategic alliance with Saudi Arabia, which campaigners want immediately curtailed. Unsuccessful war In March 2015 Saudi Arabia went to war in Yemen at the head of a coalition of 11 countries. Its aim was to reverse the takeover of the country by Houthi rebels, who are supported by Saudi Arabia's regional rival Iran, and to restore the UN-recognised President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi and his government to power. Armed with state-of-the-art US and British warplanes and their munitions, Saudi Arabia's air force and its allies have complete air superiority in the skies over Yemen, meaning they alone can carry out air strikes. These have failed to dislodge the Houthis from the capital Sanaa and from much of the heavily-populated west of Yemen. The damage inflicted on civilians has been catastrophic. The UN blames the air strikes for causing 60% of the estimated 4,000 civilian deaths. The Houthis are far from blameless. They and their allies among the forces loyal to the ousted Yemeni leader Ali Abdullah Saleh are accused of shelling densely populated areas, laying mines indiscriminately and contributing to the humanitarian crisis that now afflicts the country. They have also embedded themselves in the civilian population, exposing non-combatants to the risk of attack. Round after round of peace talks have failed to reach a compromise deal between the Houthis and the legitimate - but now deeply unpopular - Yemeni government which clings to a corner of land around the southern port of Aden. Ceasefires have been announced, and then quickly fallen apart. War crimes? The Foreign Office is at pains to point out that Britain is not a part of the Saudi-led coalition. But the fact is that British and US military hardware is sustaining the Saudi campaign and Yemenis know it. The US also provides intelligence and refuelling for the coalition. Even before Saturday's bombing of the funeral hall there were accusations that Saudi Arabia's air strikes in Yemen constituted a breach of the Geneva Convention and were possibly war crimes. The Saudis insist they abide by a strict code, the Law of Armed Conflict, and have never deliberately targeted civilians, a claim disputed by many Yemenis. The Saudis also undertake to investigate allegations that its warplanes have killed civilians through an 11-nation body called the Joint Incidents Assessment Team (JIAT). 'Criminal judging his own crime' And hereby lies the problem. The Saudis say the JIAT operates to exactly the same high standards as similar investigations carried out by US and other Western militaries. Although the JIAT has admitted to some targeting errors, several of its members are the very same countries that are part of the Saudi-led coalition. Hence the jibe on social media that their findings carry as much weight as ""a criminal judging his own crime"". Hence Britain's request to have what it calls ""oversight"" (the Saudis prefer to call it ""assistance"") into this latest incident. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon has said if it transpires that civilians were knowingly targeted last Saturday then the UK ""could review"" its defence relationship with Saudi Arabia. The Saudis have promised total transparency. That, in theory, should reveal who, if anyone, gave the order to bomb the funeral, knowing that senior Houthi rebel leaders would be present, and crucially whether or not they knew that large numbers of civilians would be hit. The Foreign Office minister's talks on Thursday could be uncomfortable for all sides."
business-18641017,Foreign start-ups discover UK venture capital,Having a clever idea and turning it into a product is just half the work for a technology start-up. Much trickier - and more time consuming - is getting the funding to make it happen.,"By Katia MoskvitchTechnology reporter, BBC News That is one reason why there is a Silicon Valley. Venture Capitalists, the joke goes, will fund anything as long as it is within one hour's drive from Sand Hill Road, where many of Silicon Valley's venture capital (VC) firms are clustered. So much for humour, but anecdotal evidence suggests that for start-ups outside the United States it is indeed much more difficult to find the money to get their venture off the ground. But if this week's Innovate Israel conference , held in London, is anything to go by, that situation is improving. Take Israeli start-up Wibbitz. One click - and your paragraph of text is turned into a lively video, as the firm's software collates images and stitches them together on the fly; no editing required. Just recently, the Tel Aviv-based company managed to secure its first major investment of $2.3m (£1.5m), from a UK branch of a Hong Kong-based venture capital firm Horizons Ventures. ""A few years ago, the only VCs that invested in Israeli companies were local Israeli VCs or a branch of US VCs, based in Israel,"" says Yotam Cohen, Wibbitz's co-founder, sitting in a crowded room full of Israeli and British entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. ""Now, I do see a trend in Israel that companies are searching for other markets, and the UK is a very interesting one."" Encouraging innovation Yossi Vardi, an Israeli investor called by many the godfather of Israel's hi-tech industry, says UK investors are realising that Israel is becoming ""recognised world over as a hot bed for innovation"". ""We now see large UK companies coming to Israel to source technology and to make investments,"" he says. But British venture capitalists believe it is more due to a change in the financial and regulatory culture in the UK itself. ""The UK has become a much more attractive place for start-ups in general, whether they're UK start-ups or Israeli start-ups, because the [current] government is taking a much more active approach to encouraging start-ups,"" says Toby Coppel from a British venture capital firm Virgin Green Fund. ""In the UK, it's cool to be a start-up now - having a corporate job used to be the thing to do, but now everyone's talking about start-ups."" Richard Anton, from Amadeus Capital Partners, agrees. ""The UK government is clearly trying to establish the country as a technological hub and that means partnering with the best in the world - and in places like the US and Israel the provision of technology is enormous"". A lot has been made of Tech City, also known as ""Silicon Roundabout"" in London's East End. In November 2010 the UK government said it wanted to turn the area into a world-leading technology hub. Currently more than 1,000 start-ups crowd the place and big tech firms have been attracted too. In March, Google opened a Google Campus there, a building full of desk space and ready-made infrastructure for young tech companies - Google mentoring included. Towards the UK ""The UK is definitely more present on the start-up map now, the entire innovation eco system is picking up here, including VCs,"" says Ido Yablohka from Israel's Clarity Ray, a firm that works with website owners to generate alternative, ""unobtrusive and user-friendly"" ads to users who have blocked regular advertising pop-ups. ""For Israeli entrepreneurs specifically, I think London is extremely well-based in terms of the European market, because of the financial conditions, the language and the location. ""The European market is something that would be silly to ignore, it's very significant - and the UK government is providing strong support [for London to become the main tech hub in Europe]."" TVTak is an Israeli start-up that came straight to the UK to find a partner - without looking elsewhere. The company promises to make your television interactive - through smartphone apps that allow viewers to interact with programmes or commercials they are watching on the big screen. Point the camera of your mobile device at the TV screen, the app ""recognises"" the content and directs you to the right webpage. ""In the UK, we did a campaign with Walkers, where people would point at a TV commercial and get an exclusive clue about the flavour of the potato chips shown on the screen,"" says TVTak's chief executive David Amselem. Viewers were then taken to a Facebook sweepstakes page, where whey could guess the flavour and win a prize. Local start-ups The hi-tech community around ""Silicon Roundabout"" may be booming and foreign entrepreneurs may be flocking to the UK in search of investors and partnerships, but many British start-ups still find it hard to secure the right kind of funding. They have to look elsewhere, either going the traditional route, to Silicon Valley, or as far away as Chile. A government programme there, called Start-Up Chile, offers aspiring entrepreneurs from around the world funding for six months to kick-start their project. Ian Ozsvald from Brighton, co-founder of an artificial intelligence firm Strongsteam, says he tried for months to get funding in the UK, but failed. Together with his fiancée Emily Toop, who heads her own start-up Tiny Ears, a firm specialising in speech recognition for children, he got the crucial first investment from the Chilean government. ""I'm getting married in a year's time, so I will be going back to the UK, but if the funding situation there doesn't change, I will have to look for money in other places,"" he says. But for Israeli entrepreneurs, at least those that came to Innovate Israel this week, the UK seems to be becoming one of the main destinations to come get money - and get noticed."
business-24112400,Barclays faces £50m fine from the FCA watchdog for Qatari deal,The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is warning Barclays Bank of a £50m fine for its 2008 investment deal with Qatari investors.,"The FCA said it had ""acted recklessly"" and breached some rules over disclosing some aspects of the deal and had failed to ""act with integrity towards holders and potential holders"" of its shares. Barclays contests the findings. The news emerged as Barclays gave details of its plan to raise £5.95bn through the issue of new shares. Shareholders are being offered one new share at 185p for every four they own. The new shares are expected to begin trading on 4 October. Probes The FCA accused the bank of agreeing £322m in secret payments to investors to gain their support for a previous share issuance, worth just over £5bn, taken up in 2008 by Qatar Holding, part of the state-owned investment authority of Qatar. Barclays said the fees were for giving advice. The deal, at the height of the credit crisis, helped Barclays to avoid the need for government help which saw rivals RBS and Lloyds end up part-owned by the UK taxpayer. As part of its share-issuing prospectus, Barclays has to disclose material facts about any potential financial risks to its business. The prospectus outlines other investigations currently being undertaken by various bodies, including the Office of Fair Trading, the Serious Fraud Office and the US Department of Justice. The probes cover - among other things - omissions over ownership of sub-prime assets, possible rigging of the energy market and various other possible market abuses. Cuts Also on Monday, Barclays Bank announced it had seen its income fall by £500m ($790m) in July and August from a year ago. It said it ""remains cautious"" about the current climate. The drop was thanks to ""significantly"" lower revenues in its investment banking division. The bank said in a trading statement: ""Barclays continues to remain cautious about the environment in which it operates and its focus remains on costs, capital, leverage and returns in order to drive sustainable performance improvements."" It added that the investment bank's daily performance in September had improved from July and August, but was still below levels seen in September 2012. Barclays said its cost-cutting was proceeding according to plan and that it expected operating costs to be £18.5bn this year, excluding restructuring costs, which would meet its target."
world-asia-china-43440877,China anti-corruption chief Wang Qishan named Xi Jinping's deputy,China's parliament has endorsed Xi Jinping for a second term and appointed Wang Qishan as his vice-president.,"The ballot at the National People's Congress unanimously approved Mr Xi while Mr Wang received 2,969 votes in favour and only one against. Wang Qishan was previously in charge of corruption investigations in China. He is a longstanding ally of President Xi and his elevation is being seen as a further consolidation of the Chinese leader's power. The recent abolition of term limits for the Chinese presidency extends to the vice-presidency, giving the position greater significance than before. China's constitution allows the vice-president to ""assist"" in his superior's work and to carry out presidential duties on his behalf - meaning Wang Qishan, possibly in his role for life, could be far more than the figurehead his predecessors were. Who is Wang Qishan? Mr Wang, 69, has held a number of prominent positions since starting work for the Chinese Communist Party in the 1980s as a policy researcher. He became mayor of Beijing during the Sars outbreak there in 2003, and was executive chair of the city's Olympic committee ahead of the 2008 games. In 2007, he joined China's Politburo and in 2009 became then-president Hu Jintao's chief negotiator in trade talks with the US. Former US treasury secretary Henry Paulson described him at the time as ""decisive and inquisitive"", and possessing a ""wicked sense of humour"". However, Mr Wang is best known for his most recent post - leading China's anti-corruption investigation. The campaign, controlled by Mr Wang as head of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, was launched in 2012 under the then newly appointed party leader, Xi Jinping. During President Xi's first five years in office, 1.34 million officials at high and low levels - people Mr Xi disparaged as ""tigers and flies"" - were brought down by corruption and disciplinary charges. Mr Wang, reportedly a friend of Mr Xi's from their youth, led the charge - becoming a feared enforcer for the Xi administration. What does his promotion mean? The end of term limits and the choice of such a prominent party member as Mr Wang could mean a change in what the role represents, analysts say. Mr Wang's experience negotiating with the US on economics is significant, given US President Donald Trump's plans for tariffs. Hua Po, an independent Chinese political commentator, told AFP news agency his appointment may be to allow Mr Wang and Mr Xi to combat President Trump, adding: ""Maybe they'll be able to come up with a solution for this massive brewing storm with America about imbalances and tariffs."" And his closeness to President Xi could mean he will make the position his own. Speaking to the New York Times, researcher Wu Qiang who was formerly at the Tsinghua University in Beijing, said Mr Wang is ""one of the most important figures"" in President Xi's administration. ""Wang Qishan will add substance to the role of vice-president,"" he said. ""The amendment of the constitution has raised the status of the presidency, and the vice-presidency will also benefit from that."""
uk-england-birmingham-54158295,Coronavirus: New restrictions in force for parts of West Midlands,New lockdown measures have come into force in the West Midlands after the number of coronavirus cases rose.,"People in Birmingham, Sandwell and Solihull are banned from meeting others who are not part of their household or support bubble, in homes or gardens. The restrictions affect about 1.6 million people and run alongside wider rules that came into force on Monday. The council is asking the government for an exemption to rules around child care after parents raised the issue. Michelle McDaid, from Solihull, who relies on her parents to help with childcare, said the rules were ""frustrating"". Dr Justin Varney, from Birmingham City Council's public health department, said: ""This... prevents family members providing childcare, and that is having significant impact on lots and lots of families."" Mr Varney said while they were not seeing any ""clear evidence of spread within schools"", the social side was causing transmission of the virus. ""Multiple children have gone to the same birthday party and are testing positive and that's leading to three or four bubbles in the same school having to be sent home to isolate,"" he said. West Midlands mayor Andy Street warned people they must comply with new restrictions or face even tougher measures. ""We will use these restrictions, look at how the numbers move, and if they are not sufficient, we might have to go further,"" Mr Street said on Sunday. ""Everybody now has to comply with these to give us the best chance."" Under the new rules, people are banned from meeting others who are not in their household or support bubble, indoors or in private gardens. People can still go out to shops, restaurants and other venues, in a maximum group of six from more than one household, but the council told people to be ""vigilant"". West Midlands Chief Constable Dave Thompson said he understood it had been a ""tough time"", but urged people to act responsibly. He said officers would aim to ""educate and encourage compliance"" with the restrictions and would focus efforts on ""disrupting flagrant breaches, such as large gatherings"". Analysis by Kathryn Stanczyszyn, BBC Radio WM political reporter Childcare is one of the big issues of these new restrictions. With a combination of people going back to work from furlough and schools facing Covid-related closures the last thing families need is the absence of grandparents too. That's why all three councils are sending a letter to government asking for special exemptions for those who have essential childcare from family members. No other area has received one yet, so it's far from guaranteed. In fact, it's believed the government originally wanted to be even stricter - so putting in place more caveats could be unlikely. But with no clue of how long these rules will be in place, it's seen as one small solution in an increasingly complex picture when it comes to keeping the virus at bay. Figures show the rate of cases per 100,000 in Birmingham to the week to 11 September was 82; for Solihull the figure was 71.2; and Sandwell stood at 64.2. Prof Alan McNally, from the University of Birmingham, said the testing situation in the city was similar to the rest of the country. ""I think you almost have a perfect storm... events have come together to almost essentially crash the testing system,"" he said. The leader of Wolverhampton Council, Ian Brookfield, advised residents not to mix households and to follow the guidance given to people in Birmingham, Sandwell and Solihull. Mr Brookfield said ""new evidence"" from the test and trace teams at the council showed 90% of all transmission is ""home-related"". Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

uk-scotland-54643340,Covid: Scots told to prepare for 'digital Christmas',"The idea of a normal Christmas is a ""fiction"" and Scots should prepare for digital celebrations, national clinical director Jason Leitch has said.","The government has insisted that the latest Covid-19 restrictions are having an impact on the spread of the virus. But Prof Leitch told BBC Scotland there was ""absolutely no question"" of a ""normal"" Christmas being allowed. Measures could be eased if case numbers fall, but Mr Leitch said people should ""get their digital Christmas ready"". Opposition politicians said the public would be ""devastated"" by the news and called for more details. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the government was making ""really tough"" decisions and would not ""tell people what they want to hear to make it easier in the here and now"". Tight restrictions on the hospitality trade focused in particular on Scotland's central belt have been extended for another week as coronavirus case numbers continue to rise. These short-term measures are to be replaced with a new five-tier system of alert levels from 2 November, although First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has warned that this does not rule out ""even tougher restrictions"" being imposed if necessary. 'Christmas is not going to be normal' Speaking on BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Prof Leitch said the current curbs - along with the ongoing ban on household gatherings - was causing a ""deceleration"" in the increase of cases. He initially said it was ""honestly too early to say"" what would happen at Christmas, but sounded a note of caution over the prospect of measures being eased significantly over the winter. He said: ""I'm hopeful costs now may get us a more family Christmas. But Christmas is not going to be normal, there's absolutely no question about that. ""We are not going to be in large family groupings, with multiple families coming round - that is fiction for this year. ""I'm hopeful that if we can get numbers down to a certain level we may be able to get some form of normality. But people should get their digital Christmas ready."" Ms Sturgeon has previously insisted it was too early to plan for Christmas, saying it was too soon to tell what impact restrictions are having on the spread of the virus. The government will publish guidance this weekend about how families should celebrate Halloween, with Ms Sturgeon saying: ""It is not safe right now to do these things as normal."" The first minister said that the more people stuck with the rules ""the more chance there is"" of a more normal festive period, but said government had to be ""honest and straightforward"" with people. She added: ""Some of the really tough additional things governments are doing right now with extra restrictions are also in part about trying to deal decisively with an upsurge in the virus now, so we give ourselves the best chance of greater normality at Christmas. ""Christmas this year for no country anywhere is going to be absolutely normal and without any restrictions. I could do what politicians would do in normal times and try to tell you otherwise, and let people down nearer the time, but that's not the right approach right now. ""We are not likely to be able to celebrate Christmas with no limits on how many people we have in our homes and on what we do."" She said that the ""best chance of getting as much normality over the Christmas period as possible is for all of us to abide by these restrictions and all the guidance right now"". Ms Sturgeon added that any restrictions would not prevent Santa from delivering presents to children on Christmas Eve, describing him as a ""key worker"". 'Huge sacrifices' Following Prof Leitch's comments, Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said the government must allow an open public debate if it ""expects months more of sacrifices"". He said: ""People have made huge sacrifices for months on end, they will be devastated to hear that Christmas as they know it is cancelled this year. ""Many will rightly question whether the government have used the past six months as well as they could have to expand testing, shore up our NHS and prepare for a second wave."" Scottish Conservative public health spokesman Brian Whittle said ""clear and concise communication"" was important in controlling the virus. He said: ""We have to be realistic and accept that this Christmas very probably won't be normal, but that's a different thing from suggesting that families might only be able to get together online. ""When the public are so desperate for information, it's vital that every minister and official chooses their words carefully."""
uk-england-london-27197241,Tube strike: Commuters suffer 'severe disruption',"Commuters travelling in London are experiencing ""severe disruption"" as Tube workers strike.","Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) Union have walked out for 48 hours over plans to close all ticket offices at a cost of 960 jobs. Transport for London said 50% of services were running compared to about 40% during the last walkout. The strike is due to end at 20:59 BST on Wednesday but disruption may continue into Thursday morning. The union and London Underground (LU) have met more than 40 times through the arbitration service Acas since the last 48-hour strike in February, but talks broke down on Monday. LU has said it plans to run as many services as possible, supplemented extra bus and river services, but customers are advised to check their journey before they travel. Services running at the moment, all with a reduced frequency and with a number of stations closed, are: Where services were being operated, trains began to run at about 07:00 and will finish at about 23:00. The last services from central London may also depart much earlier, at about 21:30. TfL said about 87% of Oyster cards that would usually be seen on the network have been used and there were almost 8,000 buses on the roads - the most ever operated in London - after an extra 266 were put into service. These included 40 vintage buses including the green AEC (Associated Equipment Company) Regent Mark III built in the 1950s. And it said there has been a 70% increase in Barclays cycle hires. TfL as a whole wants to save £4.2bn by 2020. The plans to close ticket offices are expected to save £50m a year. The RMT said it would have suspended the strike if LU had agreed to a public consultation over the plans, which do not include any compulsory redundancies. The acting general secretary of the RMT union, Mick Cash, described the strike as ""solidly supported"" and accused London Underground of backtracking on an earlier deal to review its plan to close ticket offices. ""They're looking to make £50m worth of cuts and to do that they want to get rid of every single booking office and 1,000 jobs,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Now we took industrial action in February this year and we suspended it following a deal done with our former general secretary, Bob Crow, where they had promised to review every single station. ""And there are over 200 stations and, do you know, what we've done is five."" But the managing director of London Underground, Mike Brown, told Today: ""We agreed that we would start by looking at the different station types, which group into five different types, and we'd look at those first. ""And now we're in the midst of doing the full station by station review starting with the Piccadilly Line. ""So I'm afraid what you've heard from Mick Cash is nonsense."" 'Farcical' Mayor of London Boris Johnson said the idea it was a solidly-supported strike was ""farcical"" and repeated there would be no compulsory redundancies. He added: ""This action is the result of a minority of just one union, the RMT, who are refusing to see the logic of what we are trying to achieve. ""We can't, as some would have us do, just stand by and force Londoners to pay for ticket offices. ""A resource which currently costs Londoners money, and where less than 3% of journeys begin, can be delivered better and far more efficiently with these changes."" Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted: ""It's unacceptable that millions of people are having their lives disrupted by today's Tube strike in London."" The strike is likely to hit university students taking degree exams. On its website, King's College London says it is aware of students' concerns and will review the impact of strike action. Employers' organisation the CBI said the strike was likely to have had a ""limited impact on the wider economy"". Neil Carberry, director for employment and skills, said: ""Employers make it possible for staff to work remotely. ""However, there will understandably be a significant impact on those businesses where that has simply not been possible."" The RMT is also holding a 48-hour strike which began at 03:00 on Tuesday on the Heathrow Express in a separate row over jobs, pay and cuts. And football fans travelling to Chelsea's Champions League match with Atletico Madrid at 19:45 on Wednesday will also be affected.

uk-scotland-scotland-politics-45749855,Sarwar and Baillie out in Scottish Labour reshuffle,Two of Scottish Labour's most prominent MSPs has been sacked from the party's front bench team.,"Anas Sarwar, who lost to Richard Leonard in last year's leadership contest, has been replaced as health spokesperson by Monica Lennon. And Jackie Baillie has lost her role as the party's economy spokeswoman. Ms Baillie backed Mr Sarwar for the leadership, and is a close ally of former leader Kezia Dugdale. BBC Scotland understands she was sacked over the phone five minutes before Labour issued a statement confirming the changes. Mr Sarwar said he had earlier learned through Twitter that he was to be replaced. He was leading for Labour in a health debate in the Holyrood chamber at the time. 'Best players' Both Ms Baillie and Ms Sarwar have criticised Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in the past, and have given their backing to Ms Dugdale in a row over the party withdrawing its funding for her defence in a defamation action brought by the Wings Over Scotland website. A supporter of Ms Baillie and Mr Sarwar claimed that their removal was based on ""factionalism ahead of competence"", adding: ""When you're in trouble you don't take your two best players off the pitch"". Scottish Labour's communications chief, Charlie Mann, also quit on Thursday after just five months in the job, saying he had ""decided the role is not for me"". Confirming his reshuffle, Mr Leonard - who will take on Ms Baillie's economy brief himself - thanked the outgoing members for their contribution. He added: ""My new shadow cabinet is a blend of skills and experience whose aim is to turn around Scottish Labour's electoral successes. ""By working together we will take Labour forward. It will give us the best possible chance to win again in Scotland."" 'Deeply disappointed' Mr Sarwar, who is Scottish Labour's only Asian MSP, has been campaigning against Islamophobia in the party after claiming he was the victim of racism during the leadership contest. In a statement, he said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the decision to remove him, which he said he had learned of ""through Twitter, while I was leading for Labour in a health debate in the Holyrood chamber"". Mr Sarwar added: ""For the sake of all the people who need a Labour government, I wish Richard Leonard and his shadow cabinet all the very best for the future. ""I will continue to serve my constituents tirelessly from the backbenches, campaigning for issues close to my heart including the battle against racism, prejudice and hatred."" Ms Baillie said: ""I am grateful to have had the opportunity to serve and will continue to be a strong advocate for my constituents - and Labour values. I wish Richard Leonard well for the future."" The Scottish Conservatives said the sacking of Mr Sarwar and Ms Baillie showed that Labour is ""more divided than ever"", and claimed the party had ""deliberately removed their best performers from the front bench"" as part of a ""bewildering and ridiculous political fiasco""."
uk-england-devon-56229045,Exeter WW2 bomb: People not able to go home on Sunday,People who live within 330ft (100m) of a World War Two bomb found in Exeter will not be allowed home on Sunday.,"More than 2,600 households and 12 university halls of residence were cleared before the 2,200lb (1,000kg) device was destroyed on Saturday. Police said the blast left a crater about the size of a double-decker bus. They added it was uncertain whether anyone who lived within a wider 400m (1,310ft) cordon of the scene would be allowed home either. Police have reported large pieces of metal debris hitting buildings and said some properties in the 100m (330ft) exclusion zone had sustained ""structural damage"". A resident whose home lies just outside the wider exclusion radius said hot metal had landed at the cordon's edge. The bomb was found on Friday morning by builders on private land next to the University of Exeter's Streatham campus and about 1,400 students were among the evacuees. One told the BBC that students' assignments and test preparation had been disrupted, and while the university would address those issues, having to move around had been ""inconvenient"". The halls are among the sites to which people cannot return on Sunday. The blast impact from the German device - a so-called ""Hermann bomb"" - was described by police as ""significant"", with debris thrown at least 820ft (250m) away, they said. A number of properties ""predominantly"" within the 100m-zone ""suffered structural damage, including broken windows and cracked walls"", according to the Devon and Cornwall force. ""Debris, including large metal objects, were thrown in the blast, some of which landed on nearby roofs, which require the use of a crane to remove,"" a spokesperson said. Resident Robyn Clifford, who did not have to evacuate as she lives just outside the exclusion zone, said hot metal debris landed at the edge of the 400m cordon. She said the blast happened ""really quickly and really loudly"", and she felt a ""huge whoosh of air"" through an open window as the house shook, although it was not damaged. ""We had a lot of dust and sand that settled on cars, and a neighbour in the street behind us had a piece of hot metal land very close to them,"" she said. First year business management student Toby Holden, who was re-housed in other student accommodation after the evacuations, said he was ""playing the waiting game to return"". He said: ""We have had the chance to defer our exams and assignments, so that's a good thing that uni has allowed us to do. But it's inconvenient moving around."" Bomb disposal teams destroyed the device in a 400-tonne ""box"" of sand just before 18:15 GMT on Saturday in an explosion heard up to five miles (8km) away. Police said it was due to the ""extent of essential assessment work"" that it was not possible to predict whether people in the wider, 400m-zone would be able to return home on Sunday. They added there were no public health concerns regarding the impact of the explosion, which caused a large plume of sand. Devon County Council has a helpline for evacuated residents who need support. The majority of residents who were evacuated on Saturday stayed with friends and family. Police say the council has confirmed that ""those already in hotel accommodation will be able to stay in their hotels [Sunday night] if necessary"". Council leader John Hart said all agencies involved were ""moving as quickly as we can to clear debris from the area, assess structural damage to properties and facilities, and make the area safe for the return of residents as quickly as possible"". The university said students would not be able to return to halls on Sunday but told them it would ""ensure that your alternative accommodation remains available overnight and we will continue to support you throughout"". Students in private accommodation ""should follow instructions from local authorities"", it said. It also said it was ""critical"" that no-one returned to 15 buildings and areas on campus ""before we have assessed them as safe for occupation"". However, it expected ""all academic buildings will be open as usual tomorrow [Monday]"" and anyone ""scheduled to be on campus tomorrow for work or study... should plan to attend"". Roads remain closed in the area as a result of the incident. Coastguard bosses said that their staff and volunteers who helped with evacuations and assisted police had been stood down ""after providing around 1,000 hours of support"". The city was heavily attacked by German bombers in 19 raids during World War Two, which saw more than 7,000 devices dropped, particularly in May 1942 during the Baedecker Raids.

world-us-canada-38898530,Melania Trump re-files Daily Mail lawsuit over 'lost business opportunities',"US First Lady Melania Trump has re-filed a legal case against UK newspaper Daily Mail, saying it cost her the ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity"" to profit from her brand.","Mrs Trump could have formed ""multi-million dollar business relationships"" while she was ""one of the most photographed women in the world"", the suit said. The Daily Mail had reported allegations that she once worked as an escort. It later retracted its article. Mrs Trump previously launched a legal case against the newspaper in Maryland, but it was dismissed after a judge decided the case should not be filed in the state. Mrs Trump's lawyers have now re-filed the complaint in New York, where Mail Media Inc, which owns the Daily Mail, has offices. Mrs Trump is seeking damages of $150m (£120m). The defamatory Daily Mail article meant Mrs Trump's ""brand has lost significant value"", the complaint said. Mrs Trump had the ""opportunity... to launch a broad-based commercial brand in multiple product categories, each of which could have garnered multi-million dollar business relationships for a multi-year term during which [she] is one of the most photographed women in the world"", it said. The products categories would have included clothing, haircare and makeup, it added. Issuing a retraction of the 20 August article, the Daily Mail said it ""did not intend to state or suggest that these allegations are true, nor did it intend to state or suggest that Mrs Trump ever worked as an 'escort' or in the 'sex business'."" It has not commented on Tuesday's refiling of the lawsuit. Mrs Trump also sued a US blogger, Wester Tarpley, for making similar allegations to the Daily Mail. The lawsuit was settled on Tuesday after Mr Tarpley issued an apology and agreed to pay a ""substantial sum as a settlement"", her lawyers said. Conflict concerns The Trump family has faced questions about its business interests. Mr Trump has been criticised for handing control of his business empire to his sons, rather than liquidating his business holdings to avoid any appearance of a conflict. One watchdog has launched a lawsuit against Mr Trump, arguing that as he has not divested from his businesses, he is receiving cash and favours from foreign governments through guests at his hotels and real estate deals, in violation of the Constitution. Mr Trump said the lawsuit was ""without merit""."
world-europe-35178295,Spain elections: King Felipe calls for national unity,King Felipe VI of Spain has appealed for unity and dialogue in his Christmas Eve message after elections at the weekend produced no conclusive result.,"He called for ""understanding and a fraternal spirit"" to end uncertainty. The king also called for ""national cohesion"" in what correspondents say could be criticism of separatists in Catalonia. The king has a high opinion poll rating since taking over from his father Juan Carlos in June 2014. Next month he will hold discussions with the leaders of each party that won seats in parliament. ""Political plurality, expressed at the ballot box, without a doubt offers different sensitivities, visions and perspectives; and it involves a way of exercising politics based on dialogue, consensus and commitment,"" the king said in a televised holiday message. ""Now, what should matter to all, first and foremost, is Spain and the general interest of the Spanish people,"" the monarch said. The king made his address while sitting in a chair in the throne room of the royal palace in Madrid. In what some see as an appeal for Spain to remain a unitary state, he said: ""I sincerely believe that we are living today in times where it is more necessary than ever to recognise everything that unites us."" His intervention comes after Spanish Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez and Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy compete to form the next government. Mr Rajoy's Popular Party (PP) won Sunday's vote but is 53 seats short of an absolute majority in the 350-seat chamber. For decades the Socialists and PP have alternated in government but the rise of two new parties, the left-wing Podemos (We Can) and liberal Ciudadanos (Citizens), has left Spanish politics fragmented. When Spain's parliament reconvenes in January, King Felipe will ask a party leader to form a government and MPs will vote on his nomination. If they fail to elect a government within two months then fresh elections will follow. Doing the post-election sums:"

The International Cricket Council said due to a problem delivering tickets, there had been a high volume of people collecting them at the ground. It apologised and said refunds would be automatically issued to those affected. BBC producer Emb Hashmi, who was attending the game, said it was ""absolutely frustrating"" to see queues that seemed to go on for ""miles and miles"" as fans from all over the world missed the start of the game they had paid to see. Bilal Zafar said he was queuing for more than an hour and jokingly compared the scenes to the Fyre Festival, the US music event that famously descended into chaos in 2017. Steve Elworthy, managing director of the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup, said: ""I sincerely apologise to every single fan who was affected by the queues today. ""We have delivered over 700,000 tickets to more than 120 countries, but not all tickets were successfully delivered and as such we have seen a higher volume collecting at the venue. ""It is only right that we refund these fans by way of apology. The refund will happen automatically so the fans do not need to do anything.""

world-europe-55694598,Russia Navalny: Poisoned opposition leader held after flying home,"Putin critic Alexei Navalny has been detained after flying back to Moscow from Germany, five months after he was nearly killed by a nerve agent attack.","The activist, 44, was led away by police at passport control at Sheremetyevo airport. Thousands had gathered at a different Moscow airport to greet his flight from Berlin, but the plane was diverted. Mr Navalny blames Russian authorities for the attempt on his life last year. The Kremlin denies any role. The opposition politician's allegations have however been backed up by reports from investigative journalists. News of Mr Navalny's detention prompted condemnation from the European Union, France and Italy, which called for his immediate release. US President-elect Joe Biden's incoming national security adviser echoed the call. ""The Kremlin's attacks on Mr Navalny are not just a violation of human rights, but an affront to the Russian people who want their voices heard,"" Jake Sullivan said. How did events unfold? When Mr Navalny was poisoned last August and collapsed on an internal flight in Siberia, he was flown to Germany for emergency medical treatment. As he recovered, he said he intended to return to Russia. On Sunday he made good on that pledge, boarding a Pobeda Airlines flight despite warnings he would face arrest on landing. The plane was packed with journalists, including Andrey Kozenko of the BBC Russian Service. Shortly before landing, the pilot announced that for ""technical reasons"", the plane was being diverted from Vnukovo airport to Sheremetyevo airport, causing a stir among the passengers. ""I know that I'm right. I fear nothing,"" Mr Navalny told supporters and the media upon landing, just minutes before he was detained. ""Have you been waiting for me long?"" he asked border guards. He kissed his wife Yulia - who had flown with him from Germany - after police officers warned they would use physical force if he disobeyed their orders to come with them. Despite pleas, Mr Navalny's lawyer was not allowed to accompany him. The activist is being held at a police station in Moscow. Earlier on Sunday, extra riot police were deployed and metal barriers erected inside Vnukovo airport, where the plane was originally scheduled to land. Russian media reported that a number of activists - including key Navalny ally Lyubov Sobol - had been detained. Why was Navalny detained? In a statement late on Sunday, Russia's prison service said the opposition leader ""had been wanted since 29 December 2020 for repeated violations of the probation period"". It added that he would remain in custody until a court decision. The authorities accuse him of violating conditions imposed after a conviction for embezzlement, for which he received a suspended sentence. He has always said the case was politically motivated. Separately, Russian prosecutors have launched a new criminal case against Mr Navalny on fraud charges related to transfers of money to various charities, including his Anti-Corruption Foundation. The activist earlier argued that Mr Putin was doing all he could to stop him from returning to Russia by fabricating new cases against him. The Russian authorities often make out that Alexei Navalny isn't popular with the Russian people, that he's no threat to President Putin. But his return home five months after being poisoned sparked a major police operation on Sunday. In chaotic scenes, riot police pushed Mr Navalny's supporters out of the arrivals hall of Vnukovo airport, before the flight was rerouted. Last summer, Russia's most prominent opposition figure was attacked in Siberia allegedly by an undercover hit squad of Russian security agents. His decision to return home is a direct challenge to Vladimir Putin - and creates a dilemma for the Kremlin. It risks turning him into a political martyr, a Nelson Mandela-like figure, and sparking more Western sanctions. Do nothing and the Kremlin's fiercest critic will almost certainly be a thorn in its side in an important election year. What happened to Navalny last year? In August, he collapsed on a plane flying from Tomsk in Siberia to Moscow. The pilot diverted the flight to the city of Omsk, where Mr Navalny was admitted to hospital. Two days later, Russian officials allowed him to be airlifted to Germany in an induced coma for specialised treatment. European experts later said he had been poisoned with the extremely toxic chemical weapon Novichok, developed by Soviet scientists in the Cold War. He was released from a hospital in Berlin in September to continue his recuperation. Mr Navalny said recently he was able to do push-ups and squat exercises, and therefore had probably almost fully recovered. Last month, investigative reporters named three agents of Russia's FSB security service who had travelled to Tomsk at the time Mr Navalny was there, and said the specialist unit had tailed him for years. Mr Navalny then duped an FSB agent named Konstantin Kudryavtsev into revealing details of the operation against him in a phone conversation which he recorded and posted online. The agent told him that the Novichok used to poison him had been placed in his underpants. President Putin has dismissed investigations by the Bellingcat website and other groups that have blamed Russian intelligence agents for the attack as ""a trick"". He has alleged his rival is backed by US intelligence services."
uk-politics-41836303,MPs told of school rape and sexual harassment,"Children as young as six suffer sexual violence in school, MPs heard during a debate on the issue in Parliament.","Tory MP Maria Miller said one mother had told her that her six-year-old was raped by a classmate but her teachers dismissed it as ""playful activity"". Another parent told her his daughter had been raped at school. Minister for Women Anne Milton said parents who felt their child was unsafe should go to children's social care and there remained ""much more to do"". The government also said it would issue more guidance to schools on dealing with sexual harassment. Thursday's debate followed a report published last year which suggested sexual harassment among pupils had become ""normalised"". Ms Miller, chairman of the Women and Equalities Committee, said the incident involving the six-year-old was not recorded centrally because the child was under the age of criminal responsibility. She said the second parent had said girls as young as 12 were encouraging each other to send sexual images of themselves to their peer group and were encouraged to have anal sex by their classmates. 'Epidemic of abusive photos' Labour MP John Mann described an ""epidemic of abusive sexual photographs of girls being circulated on a daily basis around schools"" and suggested ""schools and teachers have no idea what to do about the problem"". He said: ""I get very depressed by the numbers of people - usually of women - who come to see me and I find out what happened to them at school. ""Their parents do not know, they have no idea whatever. These women will not have reported to the police the fact that they have been raped. The volume is so incredibly profound that we have an epidemic in this country."" The debate follows a Women and Equalities Committee hearing last month where schools minister Nick Gibb admitted current guidance does not stop children who sexually abuse other pupils being put back in the same classroom as their victim. However Mr Gibb said this situation should not happen and said the Keeping Children Safe in Education guidance could include this when it is revised this year. In September 2015, a BBC investigation revealed there were 5,500 sexual offences recorded in UK schools between 2011 and 2014. Among these were nearly 4,000 alleged physical sexual assaults and more than 600 rapes, figures from Freedom of Information requests showed. At least a fifth of offences were carried out by children on children, but details of the rest of the assaults are not known. Since last year's report, the Children and Social Work Act (2017) has made relationships education for all primary school children and relationships and sex education for all secondary school children compulsory. Ms Miller called for more ""urgency"" from government to tackle the issue. Even when statutory guidance is issued to schools, it will still take a full academic year to come into force, she said. 'Not sufficient' Minister for Women Anne Milton said she hoped new draft regulations and guidance on relationships and sex education would be published in 2018. However she said this alone was ""not sufficient"" and ""all schools have a legislative duty to safeguard and protect children"". She added: ""In a serious situation - a number of serious and harrowing situations have been raised today - if parents or carers do not think that a child is safe, they should go to children's social care. ""Alternatively, if a parent or carer feels that a school is not fulfilling its duty because either it is not following its policies or it has inadequate policies, there is a whistleblowing line with Ofsted and the NSPCC."""
uk-politics-31036665,MP Andrew Robathan calls for wildlife laws review after finding 24 newts in his cellar,A former Conservative minister who discovered 24 great crested newts in his cellar has called for EU wildlife directives to be reviewed.,"Andrew Robathan told MPs he could have been jailed or fined £120,000 if he had moved the amphibians, which he found when he bought a semi-derelict house. He said he was a ""keen conservationist"" but added that EU laws were costing ""huge amounts of money"". The government said it was improving the way EU rules are applied. Mr Robathan, MP for South Leicestershire, raised the issue during environment questions in the Commons. ""Before I receive any hate mail, may I say I'm a keen conservationist. I like newts and bats,"" Mr Robathan told MPs. ""But there are things that are the matter with our implementation of these European habitats directives that are costing the taxpayer and indeed private citizens huge amounts of money - millions and millions of pounds."" He said government agencies had ""gold-plated"" the EU habitats directive, and continued: ""Just an example. When I bought my semi-derelict house, there were 24 great crested newts in the cellar. ""If heaven forfend I were to have picked them all up and taken them outside, I would have been liable for 12 years in jail and fined for £120,000."" Environment Minister George Eustice said the Conservative Party had a ""proud history of conservation"". He said a 2012 review of the directive's implementation showed it was working well, but identified further improvements which had now largely been delivered. He also told MPs the European Commission had now begun its own review."
newsbeat-33714117,Yahoo launches Livetext messaging app to rival Snapchat and WhatsApp,"Yahoo's unveiled a messaging app to take on the likes of Snapchat, Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.","Livetext will allow users to exchange live video, text and emoticons, but without audio. The app is available now for Apple and Android devices in the UK, US, Canada, Germany and France. ""We wanted to find that new and expressive way of communicating,"" said Adam Cahan from Yahoo at a New York media event to launch the app. Yahoo says video calls can be better than texts for expressing emotions, but their audio component makes private conversations public. With Livetext, you message friends by typing, just like texting, but you see video of friends without the audio. Yahoo has a video on its website demonstrating how Livetext works Cahan said the Yahoo team chose to focus on video without audio to encourage people to use the app in different situations. ""We wanted to make sure there is no inhibition of answering or connecting,"" he said. He said that they'd found with audio, in many situations, people ""aren't willing to engage"". At the event, product manager Arjun Sethi demonstrated ""conversations"" over smartphone connections that showed live facial expressions along with text and emoticons. ""We see video as a way to make your conversations more authentic, and we see text as a way to connect that's quick and non-intrusive,"" Sethi said. The move comes with Yahoo aiming to refocus its business on mobile and video after losing leadership in web browser search. The tech industry already has a number of messaging apps ranging from Facebook-owned WhatsApp to Snapchat, which features disappearing video messages. ""Every platform shift leads to new forms of communication, driven by our desire to connect and interact in richer ways,"" Cahan said in a statement. ""We wanted to create a new way to communicate, blending the simplicity of texting with the emotion and immediacy of live video, to make your experience spontaneous and real."" The app was tested in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Ireland, as well as some US college campuses. It's the latest example of Yahoo trying to catch up in mobile services since Marissa Mayer became the company's CEO three years ago.

business-32087038,The 2015-16 pension changes explained in 10 questions,"What the government calls ""pension freedoms"" will be in place from Easter Monday. But anyone nearing retirement would do well to note the drawbacks, as well as the advantages.","By Brian MilliganPersonal Finance Reporter 1. Who is affected by the changes? The big change affects 4.5 million people with Defined Contribution (DC) schemes. With this type of scheme your monthly pension savings go into a big pot, which will eventually be used to buy an income for your retirement. You can now access that pot freely from the age of 55 (57 from 2028), taking out as much as you like, subject to tax. Some people with Defined Benefit (DB) pensions - which promise a particular annual income - will be able to swap them for DC schemes. 2. How much tax will I have to pay? You can take 25% of your pension pot as a tax-free lump sum. Or you can take out smaller amounts, of which the first 25% will be tax free on each occasion. But you will have to pay income tax on the amount you withdraw over and above the 25% tax-free allowance. If that amount, added to the rest of your income, exceeds £42,386 (2015-16), for example, you will pay tax at 40% or more. If the amount exceeds £100,000, you will begin to lose your personal allowance, resulting in an even higher tax charge. 3. What tax will I have to pay if I buy a pension income? If you buy an annuity (an income for life), or you take income drawdown (leaving your pension pot invested), you will only pay tax on the income. Anyone with total income below £10,600 in 2015-16 will not pay anything. 4. How easy is it to pass on a pension to my dependants? The new rules make it easier. If you die before the age of 75, the pension pot can be passed on tax free. If you die after 75, and your descendants want the whole pot as a lump sum, they will have to pay 45% tax, instead of 55% previously. However, the government is considering whether to reduce this to an individual's income tax rate - known as the marginal rate - from April 2016. Those who draw down income from an inherited pot will, in any case, pay tax at their marginal rate. Pension Calculators State pension calculator DWP Combined state, workplace and DC calculator, from Standard Life Should I delay buying an annuity? Hargreaves Lansdown How much can I earn from a DC pot? Money Advice Service 5. Are annuities still a good idea? The pension changes mean that many people who would have bought an annuity, will not now do so. Income drawdown is a more flexible option for many. In fact it has not been compulsory to buy an annuity since April 2011. Nevertheless, for many people, annuities will still be the best option - or a mixture of an annuity and drawdown. 6. Can I sell an annuity if I have already bought one? In the Budget of March 2015, the chancellor said he would make this possible, and the government will now carry out a consultation. This could allow you to swap your annuity for cash, from April 2016. However, no one knows how much demand there will be for second-hand annuities. Many suspect that those selling their annuities will find it hard to get a good price. 7. What if I am in a Defined Benefit (DB) scheme - can I move to a DC scheme? In theory you can - if your employer allows it. Transferring to a DC scheme means you could get your money out more easily, and pass it on to descendants. But again, you may not get the best value. DB schemes usually offer inflation proofing, and the ability to pass some of the income on to a spouse. They also have a particular advantage if you are getting close to the maximum amount you are allowed to have in a pension pot (see below). 8. What are the new rules on how much you can save in a pension? From 6 April 2016, the maximum you can have in a pension pot will be £1m, reduced from £1.25m. This figure will rise with inflation from April 2018. The government says the change will only affect wealthy people. But a 60 year-old spending all their £1m pension pot on an inflation-linked annuity could - according to current annuity rates - expect a maximum annual income of around £27,000. You can have a larger pension pot if you wish, but you will pay 55% tax on any withdrawals. However, anyone in a DB scheme will be treated more generously. Such schemes have a notional capital value, calculated by multiplying the annual income by 20. So if the scheme pays an income of £10,000 a year, the notional value of the pension pot is £200,000. Given that the maximum pot will now be £1m, members of DB schemes can therefore expect annual incomes of up to £50,000. The annual allowance for pensions savings remains at £40,000. 9. Is the state pension changing? Yes. From 6 April 2016. The additional state pension and part of pension credit is being abolished, to be replaced with a single-tier state pension. The rate will rise from £113 a week to around £155, but the precise amount will be set towards the end of 2015. However, most people will not qualify for the full pension, as their schemes were contracted out of the second state pension, and they paid lower National Insurance (NI) contributions as a result. To qualify for the full pension, you will now need 35 years of NI contributions, instead of 30 previously. 10. What advice is available? Free guidance - not advice - is available through the Pension Wise website. Those aged 55 or above can book a telephone interview with the Pensions Advisory Service, or a face-to-face interview with Citizens Advice. The service will give general guidance, but cannot advise on specific pension policies or investments. The number to book is 030 0330 1001. Otherwise advice can be had through private providers, which will usually be chargeable."
uk-england-london-42972068,Worboys victims 'learned of his release through media',"Victims of serial sex attacker John Worboys learned about his release from prison from the media, a review found.","Many victims were ""shocked and distressed"" to see the Parole Board's decision in news headlines, Chief Inspector of Probation Dame Glenys Stacey's paper said. Her comments come as part of a review requested by the government into the ""victim contact scheme"". Two victims are set to begin a High Court battle against releasing Worboys. Dame Glenys's paper said ""poor"" correspondence included letters with errors in the women's names and addresses. She said the National Probation Scheme (NPS) ""generally complied with the scheme provisions"", but that these mistakes suggested ""a lack of care or concern"". ""Those women not in contact with the scheme - the majority - learnt of the decision through the media. All who spoke to us described their shock and distress,"" she added. ""They had not felt prepared for this outcome."" Worboys, 60, was convicted of 19 offences in 2009. He drugged his female victims before attacking them in his black cab. Before Worboys's parole hearing, the NPS attempted to contact women who had not opted into the victim contact scheme. But there was not enough time before the hearing for them to receive or absorb the letters, the report said. ""What is more, the style and content of the letters lacked clarity and urgency,"" it added. ""One woman who had engaged with the scheme from the start did make a Victim Personal Statement to the Parole Board. ""Others who we interviewed were adamant that they would have wanted to do so, had they had the opportunity."" What is the Victim Contact Scheme? The VCS, run by the NPS, supports victims of violent or sexual crimes where the defendant is sentenced to at least a year in prison or has been detained under the Mental Health Act. After defendants are convicted, victims are asked if they want to opt into the scheme. If they do, they are given a Victim Liaison Officer (VLO) who keeps them informed about the offender. Updates might include a release date, licence conditions, or if the convict is moved to an open prison. Through the scheme victims are also able to make representations about an offender's release arrangements. Dame Glenys' report found liaison between the VLO and John Worboys' offender manager was ""poor"". Justice Secretary David Gauke said the report would help the government ""review parole transparency and victim contact"". He said he was reassured that correct procedures were followed but that ""we can do much better"". ""We have already changed the letters we send to victims to make them more compassionate, clearer and more informative, but there is more to do,"" he added."
technology-18687247,Women and tech: Why don't girls want to be geeks?,"Last month Yahoo appointed a self-styled ""super geek"" as its chief executive. Nothing unusual there - except this one was a woman and a pregnant one to boot.","By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter While female tech bosses like Marissa Mayer aren't quite as rare as hen's teeth, her appointment generated far more headlines than a man's would have. So why when technology is becoming increasingly desirable, is there little desire to work in IT, especially for girls? In the UK, 84% of IT professionals are men. Many companies want more women involved - in a survey conducted by IT recruitment company CW Jobs, 64% said more females in the workplace would be beneficial. ""There is this conception that IT is men with long hair sitting in air-tight rooms programming all day,"" said the company's website director Richard Nott. Java club This image problem starts at school, according to one teacher. ""Girls don't see IT as creative. It is that image of the geek or nerd in a room typing lines of code,"" said Peter Mapstone, head of IT at King Edward VI school in Hampshire. Gender differences become apparent during IT lessons, even though there is no difference in ability, according to Carol Dawkins, an IT teacher at Toynbee School in Chandlers Ford. ""Boys are more, 'Game on' - they don't mind if they make mistakes. They are more confident around the technology, whereas girls are a little bit shy, on the back foot before they start,"" she said. The point is perfectly illustrated by Toynbee's after-school Java club - only boys have signed up. ""For the boys, hacking Linux is their comfort zone - whereas for girls, technology is all about email and Facebook,"" said Mrs Dawkins. When IBM's master inventor Mandy Chessell was at school, she said she had ""missed the memo which said that girls don't do maths and science"". But she had a rude awakening when she joined her classmates in her first O-level lesson and realised she was the only girl. Now working at IBM's Hursley laboratory, Ms Chessell has long since got used to working in male-dominated environments. It hasn't held her back - she is now one of IBM's few senior female engineers and recently won the Cisco Women In Technology award. And she is clear about the need for women at senior levels in technology firms. ""You can become a leader and you can lead in feminine ways,"" she said. For her, this means a greater emphasis on collaboration. ""For junior technology roles, often the emphasis is on logical skills, which may put girls off, but most systems these days are put together as part of team effort,"" she said. IBM has a series of projects aimed at encouraging girls to take more science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) subjects. The BBC took part in its Think IT workshop in July, where 100 girls aged 12 and 13 came to IBM's lab to find out more about how a technology product comes to market. The girls were divided into teams, each named after a famous female technologist or scientist, and asked to come up with a new piece of sport technology, from apps through to running shoes. IBM has reaped some rewards from the scheme - several girls that have been through the programme have gone on to become apprentices at the firm. Indeed the girls on the course seemed fired up by what they were doing, but none wanted to take it to exam level. Interestingly, few felt that ICT was a difficult subject, some actively enjoy it, but none of those the BBC spoke to wanted to pursue it as a career. ""I enjoy it, but I don't want to do it as a job,"" said Carys, aged 13. But it isn't down to lack of confidence in the subject. ""We are better than the boys,"" said one girl bluntly. Ruth Amos, now 23, won a young engineer of the year award when she was 16. For her, it was a gradual realisation that engineering didn't have to be about dirty overalls. ""I realised that I could do it and wear a dress and nice shoes and still be me,"" she said. She believes Stem subjects need a higher profile in the media. ""It really upsets me when I see girls watching shows like The Only Way is Essex and aspiring to be like that. Why not give that air time to inspiring them about Stem? Look at what The Apprentice and Dragon's Den have done for entrepreneurs."" she said. Recently she has taken part in Soapbox Science, a project where women in technology, engineering and science literally take to soap boxes on London's south bank to evangelise their chosen careers. But she thinks the discussion about why girls don't want to be geeks will continue for a while. ""We have been talking about it for ever and, while things are changing, it is very gradual,"" she said. Yahoo's new boss Marissa Mayer has promised to address the issue of too few women in the tech industry, but she may face a tough job. Last month Microsoft had to apologise when a chunk of code emerged labelled ""big boobs"". There is clearly some way to go."
uk-wales-23667445,Electrification: Valley lines 'need more train capacity',"More trains and carriages will be needed on south Wales valleys lines once the London to Swansea line is electrified, a transport group says.","Sewta said services in the south Wales valleys had already seen an 80% growth in passengers since 2000 and it fears overcrowding after electrification. The London-Swansea line is set to be electrified by 2018 with the valleys network by 2024. Sewta has launched a consultation on its strategy for rail improvements. The south east Wales transport alliance is made up of 10 local councils and rail organisations. The south Wales rail electrification was announced last summer by the Department of Transport. It is scheduled for completion by 2018 with the Cardiff and valleys network to follow at a cost of £350m between 2019 and 2024. Sewta said electrification ""strengthens the case for a host of further enhancements"" to the network. Its strategy document says more room on trains will be needed to cope with the anticipated extra passengers using the south Wales valleys network. Some valleys services have seen a passenger rise at a faster rate than the average for England. It said: ""In the last decade rail passenger demand on the Valley Lines has been growing at around 6% per annum with some lines experiencing 80% growth between 2000 and 2009, significantly higher than the average for the UK."" It added: ""Additional rolling stock is required to strengthen peak trains to address passenger growth and to avoid overcrowding."" Sewta's strategy calls for the whole rail network in south east Wales to be electrified by 2030. The improvements it recommends include: Sewta chair, Councillor Phil White, of Bridgend council, said: ""This report sets out an exciting programme for the next two decades. ""I would encourage communities and businesses throughout the region to let us know what they think about the priorities set out in the report."" Sewta's strategy documents are open for consultation until 30 September."

technology-16642369,Megaupload file-sharing site shut down,"Megaupload, one of the internet's largest file-sharing sites, has been shut down by officials in the US.","The site's founders have been charged with violating piracy laws. Federal prosecutors have accused it of costing copyright holders more than $500m (£320m) in lost revenue. The firm says it was diligent in responding to complaints about pirated material. In response, the hackers group Anonymous has targeted the FBI and US Department of Justice websites. The news came a day after anti-piracy law protests, but investigators said they were ordered two weeks ago. The US Justice Department said that Megaupload's two co-founders Kim Dotcom, formerly known as Kim Schmitz, and Mathias Ortmann were arrested in Auckland, New Zealand along with two other employees of the business at the request of US officials. It added that three other defendants were still at large. ""This action is among the largest criminal copyright cases ever brought by the United States and directly targets the misuse of a public content storage and distribution site to commit and facilitate intellectual property crime,""said a statementposted on its website. The FBI website was intermittently unavailable on Thursday evening due to what officials said was being ""treated as a malicious act"". The hackers' group Anonymous said it was carrying out the attacks. The Motion Picture Association of America's website also suffered disruption. Third-party sites The charges included, conspiracies to commit racketeering, copyright infringement and money laundering. A federal court in Virginia ordered that 18 domain names associated with the Hong Kong-based firm be seized. The Justice Department said that more than 20 search warrants had been executed in nine countries, and that approximately $50m (£32m) in assets had been seized. It claimed that the accused had pursued a business model designed to promote the uploading of copyrighted works. ""The conspirators allegedly paid users whom they specifically knew uploaded infringing content, and publicised their links to users throughout the world,"" a statement said. ""By actively supporting the use of third-party linking sites to publicise infringing content, the conspirators did not need to publicise such content on the Megaupload site. ""Instead, the indictment alleges that the conspirators manipulated the perception of content available on their servers by not providing a public search function on the Megaupload site and by not including popular infringing content on the publicly available lists of top content downloaded by its users."" Before it was shut down the site posted a statement saying the allegations against it were ""grotesquely overblown"". ""The fact is that the vast majority of Mega's internet traffic is legitimate, and we are here to stay,"" it added. ""If the content industry would like to take advantage of our popularity, we are happy to enter into a dialogue. We have some good ideas. Please get in touch."" Blackouts The announcement came a day after thousands of websites took part in a ""blackout"" to protest against the Stop Online Piracy Act (Sopa) and the Protect Intellectual Property Act (Pipa). The US Chamber of Commerce has defended the proposed laws saying that enforcement agencies ""lack the tools"" to effectively apply existing intellectual property laws to the digital world. Industry watchers suggest this latest move may feed into the wider debate. ""Neither of the bills are close to being passed - they need further revision. But it appears that officials are able to use existing tools to go after a business alleged to be inducing piracy,"" said Gartner's media distribution expert Mike McGuire. ""It begs the question that if you can find and arrest people who are suspected to be involved in piracy using existing laws, then why introduce further regulations which are US-only and potentially damaging?"""
business-48568338,British Steel collapse prompts parliamentary inquiry,MPs are to launch an inquiry into the UK's steel industry after the collapse of one of the sector's biggest firms.,"The move by the Business Committee follows the liquidation of British Steel last month and concerns about the impact of Brexit on the steel industry. The committee will look at the role of former owner Greybull Capital, and the government, in the company's collapse. MPs said they wanted to hold public evidence sessions with Greybull and the business secretary, among others. British Steel was placed into compulsory liquidation on 22 May, putting 5,000 jobs at risk and endangering 20,000 in the supply chain. It followed a breakdown in rescue talks between the government and private equity firm Greybull. The government is covering the firm's wage bill for now, but if a new buyer cannot be found it could be wound up and redundancies would follow. The Official Receiver has said it has made contact with more than 80 potential buyers. Rachel Reeves, who chairs the Business Committee, said: ""It is vital that the government and Official Receiver do all they can to secure a viable future for British Steel. ""However, as a select committee we want to examine questions around the collapse of British Steel and the government's approach, as well as about Greybull Capital's stewardship and its commitments to investing in its future. ""More broadly, we want to examine the serious challenges facing the future of the steel sector in the UK."" 'Perilous, uncertain place' Ms Reeves said the inquiry would examine the serious challenges being faced by the steel sector in the UK. She said long-term industry concerns on issues like energy costs and business rates had been ""largely unaddressed"" by the government. The inquiry will also explore whether additional responsibilities should be required of the owners of national strategic assets. Unite's assistant general secretary Steve Turner welcomed the inquiry, adding: ""We need to look seriously at how a strategically important national industry has ended up in such a perilous, uncertain place, and then we need government to take the steps necessary to bring security to the sector."" He added that it was right that Greybull's role in the collapse was thoroughly examined. Greybull bought the business for £1 from Tata during depths of the 2016 steel crisis in the hopes of turning the business around, going on to rebrand it as British Steel. It had sought financial support from the government before it was placed in liquidation. The firm was hit by a slump in orders from European customers ‎due to uncertainty over Brexit, as well as a weakening in the pound since the 2016 EU referendum."

world-latin-america-41635008,The avocado police protecting Mexico's green gold,Tancítaro looks and feels like a typical Mexican town: There is a central square with a bandstand and a little church.,"By Katy WatsonBBC News, Tancítaro, Michoacán A mariachi band is playing as I arrive. The music is part of a funeral procession with Tancítaro residents watching on. But there is something that makes this quaint little town feel different. The pickup trucks ubiquitous in Mexico are shinier and newer here. Tancítaro is powered on avocados, its people are rich from Mexico's green gold. This town is known as Mexico's avocado capital. The municipality of about 30,000 people produces enough avocados to satisfy the demand of all of California. Mexico produces about 45% of the world's avocados and Michoacán is Mexico's largest avocado-producing state. From here alone, nearly two billion avocados are shipped to the US every year. And because the industry is a lucrative one, it has been the target of organised crime. As you enter Tancítaro, there are a series of checkpoints. They are known as filtros, or filters, by people here. Some are more informal than others. One has a few sandbags and some elderly men sitting on a broken car seat outside a hut. We pass another one with several pickup trucks standing outside. I notice a man with a rifle across his back. This is a well-armed town. Michoacán is where the ""war on drugs"" started in 2006. The strategy was launched by the then-president, Felipe Calderón, and its aim was to crack down on drug cartels by sending in troops. But far from solving the problem of drug-related killings, it caused the cartels to fragment and violence increased further as rival factions fought each other for control of the drugs trade. ""From 2007, armed people started coming,"" says the mayor of Tancítaro, Arturo Olivera Gutiérrez. ""They started to pressure local authorities, to take control of the local police and take over the population through fear. Many people disappeared, they started killing, intimidating, taking over land."" In the absence of an effective police force, communities armed themselves to ensure the security of their towns, leading to the emergence in 2013 of ""self-defence groups"" in Michoacán. The same happened in Tancítaro, too. But while in other parts of Michoacán the self-defence groups were taken over by organised crime or dismantled by government forces, residents of Tancítaro did something different. Avocado police On one side of the town's main square is the headquarters of Tancítaro's public security body (CUSEPT). There are nine or 10 people standing outside wearing body armour and carrying guns. ""The self-defence groups freed the municipality from organised crime and then, in conjunction with the government, we worked with the avocado producers to recruit police,"" explains José Hugo Sánchez Mendoza, the head of CUSEPT. ""The first prerequisite was that the force be made up of people from this municipality."" The police force is part-funded by avocado producers, who pay a percentage of their earnings depending on how many hectares they own. The municipal government also contributes to the force and its members get training from federal forces. Everyone in CUSEPT is connected to the avocado trade in some form, which Tancítaro's mayor reckons is its recipe for success. People have a lot to lose and want to protect it, he explains. They also have money. Their equipment is impressive. They all carry arms, wear body armour and have a bullet-proof pickup. On one of their patrols, I sit next to Lorena Flores, who has her own farm. She tells me she signed up because she was fed up with paying extortion to criminals. She works with the force from Monday to Friday, eight to four. The time off is spent on her farm. She says that life here is much safer now. Community watchdogs At one point we stop at a junction where there is a checkpoint, a two-storey house painted in camouflage colours. Opposite the checkpoint is a group of men, chatting by their cars. They are one of 16 different community groups that work with police here, tipping them off about anything that is suspicious. The men told me they had weapons but did not want to show me. The police say the community groups do not carry guns openly but that they are there to help the police and inform them. It is a bit of a grey area but one that seems to work for the town. Better safe than sorry Later I meet Chema Flores, a wealthy farmer who has been in the avocado business since 1982. He says he never imagined the demand for avocados would take off the way it has. It has changed his life for good and bad. Down the side of the driver's seat I spot a huge gun. I ask him why he has it. ""At the moment, here it's safe, there's lots of security but in other areas it's ugly, I don't want to lie,"" he tells me. ""They kidnapped my son when he was 16. They asked for $1m [£760,000] but I only had $500,000 to give them. I was also kidnapped twice."" He tells me he has permission to carry a gun and employs four armed bodyguards to protect him and his son around the clock. The need for such security feels extreme for a farmer but you can see how the alternative could be worse. Everyone in the town tells me that there are no kidnappings, no extortions now. Producers like Lorena and Chema can sleep sound at night. Tancítaro's heavily armed avocado police in its own way is a bright spot in a dark period for Mexico. This year so far is the deadliest for the country in two decades."

The campaign follows a survey of 2,000 residents, in which 92% said they felt the tram works had affected their enjoyment of the city centre. Almost 30% said they shopped there less than they did a couple of years ago. However, 87% of the people questioned said they were now open to coming back into the city centre more often. Officials said the campaign was targeted at residents of Edinburgh and people who lived within a two-hour drive of the city. The campaign, called This is Edinburgh, aims to increase footfall to the centre by 2% above the national average. Hidden gems Andrew Burns, Edinburgh City Council's leader, said: ""Edinburgh is a unique and world class place but we recognise that some folk may be out of the habit of coming into town. ""This campaign lets the city speak for itself, reminding people of the fantastic and diverse proposition that the city centre has to offer."" John Donnelly, Marketing Edinburgh chief executive, said: ""When we set out to create the campaign, we spoke with lots of different groups, listening to their opinions on Edinburgh. ""Overwhelmingly, our research found that residents had become very resistant and unresponsive to what they see as adverts of Edinburgh for the tourists. ""What did excite them however was the idea of rediscovering their city, finding its hidden gems and engaging residents in that conversation through social media."" This Is Edinburgh advertising was created by Edinburgh-based agency, The Lane. The first TV advert will air on Monday at 19:45 on STV."

Now open at the Curve Theatre, Leonie Orton-Barnett said his plays were still important today. ""He would have loved this,"" she said.

entertainment-arts-52796215,The Archers returns with a lockdown twist,"The Archers returned to BBC Radio 4 on Monday, with a ""new style"" forced upon the show by the coronavirus lockdown.","Large cast recordings with interaction between multiple characters have been scrapped in favour of monologues recorded at the actors' homes. ""It might take a few episodes for listeners to get used to the new style,"" said Charlotte Martin, who plays busybody Susan Carter. ""It will be different [but] I think it will be enjoyable,"" she said. The rural drama resumed after a three-week break in which classic episodes kept listeners in touch with the residents of Ambridge. The first voice to be heard in the ""lockdown era"" was Tim Bentinck, who plays David Archer. The actor said he was ""incredibly proud"" to be pioneering the new format. ""As from Monday, the story of the now-virus-hit Ambridge will be told from the minds of the village characters, in a way that has never been heard in all its sixty-nine years,"" he wrote on Twitter. For the first time, listeners will get to hear what the characters ""really think"", he continued. ""As actors, we're always after the sub-text - what we say is not necessarily what we mean. Now, what we think is not necessarily what we say!"" Although the characters will be subject to the same restrictions as the rest of the UK, the plot won't focus solely on coronavirus - with upcoming episodes featuring storylines about Tracy and Harrison competing to become captain of the village cricket team, and a minor emergency caused by a broken down forage harvester. Last week, the series' editor Jeremy Howe revealed how coronavirus had thrown the soap's plans into disarray. ""We binned 12 scripts and five weeks' worth of storylines that were about to be written,"" he told Radio Times. ""We then started inventing stories that were set in Ambridge, where the coronavirus had now arrived, that could be told in a way that both reflected the lockdown and could be recorded in the cast's homes. ""I told the team - keep it simple."" For the actors, the lockdown meant recording their monologues at home in hastily-constructed makeshift studios. Annabelle Dowler, who plays Kirsty Miller, has been recording her scripts in her daughter's wardrobe, surrounded by duvets and and an old mattress to mask any external noises. On her Twitter account, she shared a photo of the notice she'd attached to the wardrobe door, warning her children to keep their distance. ""Stay away and be silent otherwise you will get into trouble with the BBC and we will have no iPlayer for the rest of the lockdown!"" Her co-star Charlotte Martin explained the challenges of recording in her bedroom. ""A studio is soundproof, whereas suddenly we were having to do it in our own homes,"" she said. ""I've got my two daughters home and making sure everything is quiet, that nobody is opening doors, that was tricky. I think my husband came up the stairs at one point and we had to redo that!"" She added that, as the crew adapt to new ways of recording the 69-year-old drama, they might be able to start incorporating more voices. ""There may be ways that we can get actors talking to each other or create ways in which we can interact with more than one character at a time, but that will be in the future."" In the meantime, the lockdown has provided one character with a lucky escape. Before the lockdown, Kirsty was due to marry handyman Philip Moss, who listeners recently discovered was an illegal gangmaster - employing slave labour in his building firm. For now, at least, those plans are on hold. Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts. If you have a story suggestion email entertainment.news@bbc.co.uk."

world-europe-50955273,Russia-Poland row over start of WW2 escalates,"A row between Russia and EU countries over the causes of World War Two has escalated, with a top Russian official condemning the US ambassador to Poland.","Parliament Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said a tweet by Ambassador Georgette Mosbacher was ""insulting"" to Russians and Americans. On Monday she tweeted: ""Dear President Putin, Hitler and Stalin colluded to start WWII."" President Vladimir Putin says Poland and its allies are distorting history. During a marathon news conference on 19 December, the Russian president said it was ""totally unacceptable and inaccurate"" to cast equal blame on Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin for the war's outbreak. Mr Putin said he had requested Soviet archive documents in order to write an article on the subject - Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 - and, in his view, to set the record straight. He argued that the Western powers and Poland had appeased Hitler's aggression by letting him grab Czechoslovakia in 1938. The Nazi invasion of Poland came just a week after Hitler's Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop and Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov had signed a non-aggression pact on 23 August 1939, which stunned the world. A secret clause in the pact carved up Eastern Europe into Nazi and Soviet spheres of influence, allowing the two dictators - one fascist, the other communist - to occupy and dismantle Poland. Ms Mosbacher's tweet recalled that Poland was a victim of the two dictators. But Mr Volodin, who is close to Mr Putin, said the US state department ought to make sure that an ambassador such as Ms Mosbacher had sufficient knowledge of a country's history before sending her to work there. Mr Putin has revived wartime Soviet symbols, and portraits of Stalin are commonly displayed in Russia now. In 2020, the 75th anniversary of the Allies' victory over Nazi Germany will be marked. More than 20 million Soviet citizens died in what Russians call the ""Great Patriotic War"" after the Nazis invaded the USSR in 1941. Mr Putin's father served in Stalin's NKVD secret police and was severely wounded in the war in 1942. President Putin argued that Stalin had tried to forge an anti-Hitler alliance with Britain, France and Poland, but that the Munich Agreement in 1938 - dooming Czechoslovakia - had scuppered that plan. Stalin then had to reach a deal with Hitler, feeling betrayed by the West, he argued. However, Western historians point out that the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact meant Hitler did not have to fear a clash with the USSR if he invaded Poland, so giving him the assurance he needed. Moreover, Stalin then supplied the Nazi war machine with raw materials, which helped fuel - literally - Hitler's aggression against Western Europe. How has this row escalated? Monday, 30 December: Besides the tweet by the US ambassador, Germany's ambassador to Poland - Rolf Nikel - also wades into the row, tweeting: ""The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact served to prepare the criminal invasion of Nazi Germany against Poland. The USSR together with Germany participated in this brutal division of Poland."" 29 December: Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki issues a statement accusing Mr Putin of using the World War Two issue as a means to cover up recent international setbacks for Russia, such as the sports sanctions imposed over Russian doping. Mr Morawiecki says ""President Putin has lied about Poland on numerous occasions"". 27 December: Poland's foreign ministry summons the Russian ambassador to protest, recalling that the war began with the Nazi-Soviet pact, and that Poland lost about six million citizens in the war. Earlier, Mr Putin had scorned Poland and Western powers for appeasing Hitler and had labelled Poland's ambassador to Berlin in the 1930s an ""anti-Semitic swine"". 19 September: A European Parliament resolution - politically significant, but not a law - urges EU states to ""make a clear and principled assessment of the crimes and acts of aggression perpetrated by the totalitarian communist regimes and the Nazi regime"". It describes the war as ""an immediate result"" of the infamous Nazi-Soviet deal in 1939."

The Peak District became the UK's first National Park 63 years ago. Google has marked the anniversary by posting an image of the Salt Cellar - an unusually shaped gritstone tor on Derwent Edge - on its front page. Peak District National Park chief executive Jim Dixon said: ""It is amazing to think that, thanks to technology, many more people will be able to enjoy the outstanding natural beauty of the Peak District. ""The Trekker will help bring the Peak District to life online and hopefully inspire families to come and enjoy a walk or a cycle ride in the most beautiful landscapes."" The Trekker equipment is designed to capture locations the Street View car and tricycle cannot reach. Previous locations captured by the technology include the Grand Canyon and the Taj Mahal. Peak District staff expect to start filming in May and June, and the images will appear on Google Maps in June or July. The locations to be captured will include all of the Peak District's traffic-free routes, including the Tissington, High Peak, Monsal and Thornhill trails. The views at Stanage Edge, where Kiera Knightley daydreamed of Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, will also be stored. The Derwent Valley - where the World War Two Dambusters raid was rehearsed - will also feature."

In a bid to clear the backlog, street cleaning staff will be diverted to waste removal duties on Sunday. Crews will be out on Monday ""to catch up on any outstanding collections"". A council spokesman said the problems had been caused by ""the large amounts of waste being put out to be collected"". Second setback By Tuesday, domestic waste crews will be working as listed in the council's Christmas card advertisement which was sent out to residents in the Grimsby, Cleethorpes and Immingham areas. However, street cleansing and grounds maintenance staff would still be diverted, if required, to ensure that any outstanding backlog of waste was collected, the council said. During those three days, the community recycling centre sites on Estuary Way, Grimsby and Queens Road, Immingham, will also be open between 0800 GMT and 1800 GMT. Residents who had not received a kerbside recycling collection by 1600 GMT on Friday 31 December should put out the waste from Tuesday 4 January and it would be cleared by Friday 7 January, the council added. It is the second time in a month that the council has had to deal with a significant backlog of waste. It was forced to suspend collections for two weeks just before Christmas as heavy snow and ice made driving conditions hazardous."
uk-wales-46126048,Outdated NHS Wales IT system 'needs a reboot',"Computer systems in the Welsh health service are ""outdated"" and failures are having a ""negative impact"" on patients, according to a new report.","By Geraint Thomas BBC Wales News An Assembly inquiry questioned the ""competence, capability and capacity"" of the body that looks after IT, the NHS Wales Informatics Service (NWIS). There were 21 systems outages in the first half of this year, according to the public accounts committee. The NWIS and Welsh Government said they would review the findings in detail. Committee chairman Nick Ramsay said the cross-party report had uncovered a ""raft of problems"" in the dysfunctional system. ""As we begin scrutinising one area, we find that other, equally serious questions arise elsewhere,"" the report said. ""As a consequence, we are anxious that our scrutiny has merely scratched the surface of NWIS' problems."" NWIS was established in 2010 to deliver technology and digital services for patient care in Wales. Establishing electronic patient records in Wales was one of its main projects. But the report said there were ""too many cases (where) the NHS relies on outdated, paper-based records"" when electronic records could lead to better patient care. The committee said they were ""particularly concerned"" to hear about the impact of outages on patient experience and staff morale at Cardiff's Velindre Hospital, although witnesses assured the committee no patients had come to harm during the IT failures. The cancer IT system, CaNISC, was highlighted as a particular problem, with the report stating committee members were ""alarmed"" by evidence Microsoft stopped providing support for the system in 2014 and it posed a cyber security risk. Richard Pugh, head of services at cancer charity Macmillan in Wales, said: ""Continuing with the current 'patch-and-mend' approach on an obsolete IT system will not only heap additional pressure on our hard-working cancer care workforce, it runs the risk of putting cancer patients in Wales at risk and creating unnecessary stress for those going through treatment."" However, AMs acknowledged ""funding is stretched"", with NWIS trying to keep its existing system going while under pressure to deliver new ones. The committee's inquiry followed a report by the Auditor General for Wales, published in January, which concluded that plans to digitise patients' NHS records in Wales face significant delays. Mr Ramsay added: ""Our inquiry has raised serious question marks about the competence, capability and capacity across the health system to deliver a digital transformation in Welsh healthcare. ""We trust our inquiry and this report will be a wake-up call to all those involved in harnessing the power of digital innovation to improve healthcare in Wales. We believe it's time for a reboot."" Recommendations include a call for a review of senior leadership capacity within both NWIS and the wider NHS digital team. GPs said the report had raised some ""alarming findings"" and data outages were becoming ""all too common"". Dr Peter Saul, of the Royal College of GPs in Wales, said: ""Today, IT systems are as critical to clinicians as stethoscopes and scanners. Data outages can be extraordinarily disruptive for practices and for patients. ""They affect appointments, prescriptions and the nuts and bolts of a functioning practice and can take hours to recover from."" The NWIS welcomed the report and said it had been ""pleased to share insight into the specification, planning, delivery and management of national digital health and care services for Wales"". The Welsh Government said it would provide a considered response in due course."
world-latin-america-38207924,Javier Duarte: Mexico seizes fugitive governor's art,"Mexican police have raided a ranch belonging to the former governor of the state of Veracruz, Javier Duarte.","Mr Duarte stood down from his post in October to face corruption charges and disappeared a week later. Officers searching his luxury ranch seized 17 paintings believed to be by famous artists such as Joan Miro, Fernando Botero and Leonora Carrington. Police continue to search for Mr Duarte, who has been charged with organised crime and money laundering. Mr Duarte denied the accusations made against him before his disappearance but has not spoken out since. Veracruz Governor Miguel Angel Yunes Linares, who took over as governor last week, said the works of art seized on Sunday would be auctioned off. The proceeds would be used to finance a children's hospital, he said. Luxury retreat Mr Yunes alleged that the property had been furnished using money siphoned off from public funds. ""More than 200m pesos ($9.7m; £7.6m) stolen from the people of Veracruz were spent doing up this house so that Duarte could have people over, now he won't host anything any more,"" he said. Officials said the paintings would still have to be verified by experts but they believe they are dealing with works by Mexican painters David Alfaro Siqueiros and Rufino Tamayo, Spanish artist Joan Miro and English-born Mexican painter Leonora Carrington. Officers also found a sculpture by Mexican artist Javier Marin and copies of historic documents such as Mexico's Declaration of Independence. They said the combined value of the works of art seized would still have to be determined. They had been stored in a cellar in Mr Duarte's weekend retreat. The ranch has 25 rooms, a helicopter landing pad, two tennis courts and extensive grounds just outside the city of Cordoba, in north-eastern Veracruz."

It is her eighth number one, meaning she has overtaken Elton John, Cliff Richard and George Michael in the all-time chart leaderboard. ""I'm lost for words,"" said the star. ""Thank-you to everyone who has supported this album. I'm so touched that it's made its way to your hearts. I love it.""

The Beatles, Elvis Presley, The Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan have also landed chart-toppers across five decades, though not consecutively. Kylie's eight chart-toppers Kylie's chart-topper was made in the middle of the lockdown, with the star forced to buy recording equipment and learn computer software so she could record her vocals at home. She told BBC News the project had been a lifeline when quarantine threatened to overwhelm her. ""It's hard to dig deep and stay positive,"" the 52-year-old said, ""and I had a moment like that, during the first lockdown where I had to confess to someone else that I was struggling. ""And actually, if I wasn't able to work on the album, I perhaps would have gone the other way."" Minogue finished ahead of Little Mix, whose album Confetti debuted at number two in the Official Album Chart. Ariana Grande's Positions, which was top of the pile last week, dropped to third.

uk-england-cambridgeshire-13750210,Peterborough council may offer homebuyers cash support,First-time homebuyers in Peterborough could soon be receiving financial help from the city council.,"At a cabinet meeting on Monday councillors agreed to set aside £1m for loans under the Local Authority Mortgage Scheme (LMA). The Conservative leader of the council, Marco Cereste, said: ""It's going to be great for the city."" However, Labour councillor Ed Murphy said the scheme would not assist those most in need. ""This is not going to be helping the low-paid and unemployed,"" said Mr Murphy. However, he said he would consider supporting the scheme if the council was to work with a mutual instead of ""private banks which brought the economy down."" 'Unlock the chain' The LMA has been developed by Sector Treasury Management services, working with Lloyds TSB. In March, five councils in England said they would pilot the scheme. However, Peterborough council said it did not want to wait until a pilot is completed. ""I think it's a way to help people in our city get on the housing ladder, get themselves a home, and we should go for it,"" Mr Cereste said. The council wants to commit an initial £1m and if it works it will invest a further £9m. ""We'd calculated that we could help probably 400 people,"" he said. ""We are talking about first-time buyers, so it means... you're unlocking the chain in many instances. ""Sometimes there are two or three people in the chain so you could unlock 1,200 house sales."" He also said it would not cost the city's taxpayers. ""We get a decent rate of interest on our money from the banks, and we would need about 10 times the normal amount of defaults for us to start losing money,"" he said. Mr Murphy however, would prefer the council to supply its own loans, which has been done in the past. 'More public housing' ""The council should use its powers to support a housing association to build more social housing for rent,"" he said. ""It is still a cautious time for people to be buying housing. ""We need more public housing and jobs."" The average first-time buy house in Peterborough costs around £100,000. Under the LMA scheme, first-time buyers would have to provide a 5% deposit, the council will indemnify a further 20% and the bank would loan the other 75%. Cecilia Booth, who came up with the scheme for Sector Treasury Management, said: ""The mortgage applicant will only have to find a 5% deposit but will pay back 95% of the loan. ""The indemnity will be in place for five years so it's not for the whole life of the mortgage."" She said Lloyds TSB was the first bank to come on board but others would be joining ""very soon"". A final decision on whether to go ahead with the scheme will be taken at a full council meeting in July.

He was sworn into office in the communist country in 2016, following a stint as public security minister. The role of president in Vietnam is largely ceremonial.

A major search took place including police, the RAF and rescue dogs. He was spotted by a wildlife photographer on Tuesday morning, who saw him waving at her near Keld. Mr Harvey was about six miles (10km) from where he was last seen. He was then taken by Land Rover to the nearby Tan Hill Inn, where he was reunited with family and friends at the press conference. Speaking to journalists Mr Harvey, from Tynemouth in Tyne and Wear, said: ""I just got separated by getting caught in a really heavy hailstorm, a howling gale of wind. ""By the time I got my kit on it was getting really dark, so I missed what I would say was a turning. I had a plan B straight away, find somewhere safe to camp, put my tent up, keep warm, and that was it. ""The biggest problem I had was getting to Tynemouth from Keld, because I only had £21.05 in my pocket."" Mr Harvey said he had ""three good nights wild camping"". ""The place where we got separated was absolutely desolate, there was no chance of putting a tent up that's for sure, so I had to find somewhere safe, which is what I did."" Mr Harvey said he was never worried as he had ""all the kit and all the training"", adding he would rather not have the attention which he said was ""not my scene at all"". The experienced hiker, who was reported missing on Sunday afternoon, said he could see search teams but did not realise they were looking for him. His family said the past three days had been ""torture"" and they could not put the worry they had into words. ""We know he is experienced, but not three nights, that's taking it a little bit to the extreme,"" they said. Insp Mark Gee, from North Yorkshire Police, said: ""This is fantastic news. I want to thank all the search volunteers for their time, as well as gamekeepers, estate owners, farmers and local residents for their help and understanding.

world-latin-america-35269411,'El Chapo' returned to Mexico Altiplano prison,"Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman has been recaptured and sent back to the maximum-security prison he escaped from six months ago.","He was paraded before cameras before being bundled into a helicopter to Altiplano prison in central Mexico. He escaped from there in July through a tunnel dug in the showers. Guzman was arrested on Friday in the city of Los Mochis in his home state of Sinaloa - which he had come to dominate through the drugs cartel he led. During the early-morning raid, he managed to flee through a drain but was later caught by marines in a shootout. Six people, including one marine, are reported to have been killed. Part of the reason he was tracked down was because he contacted actors and producers in the hope of making a film about his life, Mexico's Attorney General Arely Gomez said. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto described Guzman's arrest as a ""victory for the rule of law"". Katy Watson, BBC Mexico and Central America reporter The capture of El Chapo will be a big boost to President Enrique Pena Nieto's administration. The escape last July of Mexico's most-wanted criminal was politically embarrassing. It made the government look stupid at best and institutionally corrupt at worst - many people doubted El Chapo's escape could have happened without inside help. It was made worse too by the fact that the president had previously said that if he escaped again it would be unforgivable. Mr Pena Nieto has called the arrest ""mission accomplished"" - hopefully it is third-time lucky for the government with El Chapo remaining behind bars and the president's legacy not being that of allowing a violent criminal to escape. Who is 'El Chapo' Guzman? The US congratulated the Mexican government but did not indicate whether prosecutors would seek Guzman's extradition. In a statement, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Guzman had caused ""significant violence, suffering and corruption on multiple continents"". Guzman's July escape was his second - he was first arrested in Guatemala in 1993 and escaped from Puente Grande jail in 2001, reportedly in a laundry basket after bribing officials. He was on the run for 13 years before being held again in 2014. CCTV footage of his 11 July escape showed Guzman pacing his cell several times before heading into the shower area and disappearing at the maximum-security Altiplano jail. A huge manhunt followed, with flights suspended at the nearby airports. The US government had offered a $5m (£3.2m) reward for information leading to his capture. Authorities located him several days ago based on reports that he was in the Los Mochis area. In October, Mexican officials said they had ""broken up"" and arrested the group responsible for helping him escape. Guzman's wealth is estimated at $1bn. Despite being the leader of one of the world's most powerful and violent drug cartels, Guzman was seen by some in Sinaloa - where there are few job opportunities - as a modern-day Robin Hood figure who could offer more security to people than the government. Following his escape, shopkeepers began selling souvenirs such as baseball caps branded with ""El Chapo"" (Guzman's nickname, meaning ""Shorty"")."
uk-politics-54419352,Rishi Sunak vows to 'balance books' despite pandemic,"The chancellor has vowed to ""always balance the books"", despite increased spending in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.","In a speech to party members, Rishi Sunak said the Conservatives had a ""sacred duty"" to ""leave the public finances strong"". He vowed the use the ""overwhelming might of the British state"" to help people find new work. But he said debt and spending needed controlling ""over the medium term"". In an online speech during the Conservatives' annual party conference, he said: ""I won't stop trying to find ways to support people and businesses."" However, he added the party could not argue there was ""no limit on what we can spend"", nor that ""we can simply borrow our way out of any hole"". Mr Sunak cited the furlough scheme and its successor, the jobs support scheme, as examples of government action to support employment during the crisis. He said though that, although the government would ""keep striving to be creative"" on employment support, he would also have to be ""pragmatic"". He told members that ""no chancellor"" would be able to save every job or business, adding changes to the economy due to Covid-19 ""can't be ignored"". Official figures published in September show government borrowed £35.9bn in the previous month, its highest amount for August since records began in 1993. Borrowing between April and August totalled £173.7bn, as ministers spent billions on coronavirus-related schemes to support the economy. Sunak keen to shrug off big-spending reputation Government borrowing is at stratospheric levels because of the pandemic. It is not clear precisely what the chancellor means, promising to get it under control in the ""medium term"". Nor was there even a whisper of how that could be done. Treasury sources suggested it's unlikely to happen by the time of the next election, likely to be in 2024. But while the chancellor's first few months in the job have been characterised by enormous crisis-level spending, that is a characteristic that he is keen to shrug off. Read more from Laura In an interview after his speech, the chancellor said government debt - which passed £2 trillion for the first time in history in August - was vulnerable to increases in borrowing costs. ""Now that we have so much debt, it doesn't take a lot for suddenly 'yikes' - we have to come up with X billion pounds a year to pay for higher interest,"" he said. Mr Sunak - who has been touted as a potential future Tory leader - also said he did not want to become PM, and described his ""close personal friendship"" with Boris Johnson. Asked if he eventually wants to replace Mr Johnson, he replied: ""No. Definitely not seeing what the prime minister has to deal with, this is a job hard enough for me to do."" BBC economics editor Faisal Islam said: ""The chancellor knows that just days after his Winter Economic Plan, with unemployment set to go above 5%, and social restrictions intensifying, not loosening, there is now further backroom pressure to increase the generosity of his worker subsidy schemes. ""This is a continuation of the pattern we have seen in the past few weeks since the cancellation of the Budget. There'll be more support for the economy, but with the really tough decisions - for example, on tax, - put off. In response to his speech, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said Mr Sunak had ""nothing to say"" to millions of people whose jobs were at risk. She told reporters more ""targeted support"" was required for sectors of the economy that have been hardest hit by restrictions during the pandemic. ""Sadly there was nothing from the chancellor today to suggest that he grasped the magnitude of the jobs crisis we're facing,"" she added. Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of business lobby group the CBI, said the best way to balance the books was by ""protecting our economy's ability to recover"". Adding that the costs of the pandemic had fallen ""deeply and unevenly,"" she said it was vital to protect at-risk sectors such as aviation, manufacturing, and hospitality. Do Conservative governments balance the books? Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the virtual Conservative Party conference: ""This Conservative government will always balance the books."" If it does, that would be an unusual achievement. Balancing the books usually means that a government has repaid more than it has borrowed in a year - ie it's in surplus. The government can still have debt overall, but the debt hasn't risen during the year. The last time that a government balanced the books was under the Labour government in 2000-01, and for the two years before that. The most recent Conservative government to achieve that was under Margaret Thatcher in 1988-89 and 1989-90. Another measure that recent governments have liked to talk about is whether the economy is growing faster than the debt. If it is, the government can say that debt is falling as a proportion of GDP (which is the value of everything produced by the economy in a year). That happened in both 2017-18 and 2018-19."
world-europe-17988453,Turkey country profile,"Once the centre of the Ottoman Empire, the modern secular republic was established in the 1920s by nationalist leader Kemal Ataturk.","Straddling the continents of Europe and Asia, Turkey's strategically important location has given it major influence in the region - and control over the entrance to the Black Sea. Progress towards democracy and a market economy was halting after Ataturk's death in 1938, and the army - seeing itself as guarantor of the constitution - repeatedly ousted governments seen as challenging secular values. Joining the European Union has been a longstanding ambition. Membership talks were launched in 2005, but have stalled over serious misgivings about Turkey's human rights record. Kurds make up about a fifth of the population. Kurdish separatists who accuse the Turkish state of seeking to destroy their cultural identity have been waging a guerrilla war since the 1980s. FACTS Republic of Turkey Capital: Ankara Population 79.5 million Area 779,452 sq km (300,948 sq miles) Major languages Turkish (official), Kurdish Major religion Islam Life expectancy 72 years (men), 79 (women) Currency Turkish lira LEADERS President: Recep Tayyip Erdogan Recep Tayyip Erdogan won a new term in elections in June 2018 and also gained substantial new powers under a new system approved the previous year by voters. He first came to power in 2003 in the wake of a sweeping electoral victory by the Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party (AKP), of which he was a founding member. He spent 11 years as Turkey's prime minister before becoming the country's first directly-elected president in August 2014 - a supposedly ceremonial role. To his supporters Mr Erdogan has brought Turkey years of economic growth, but to his critics he is an autocratic leader intolerant of dissent who harshly silences anyone who opposes him. In July 2016, the AKP government survived an attempted coup which saw clashes on the streets of Istanbul and Ankara that left 256 people dead. The authorities subsequently detained thousands of soldiers, judges, teachers and civil servants on suspicion of involvement in the attempt, which President Erdogan said was inspired by his exiled opponent Fethullah Gulen. A referendum in April 2017 narrowly backed switching to a presidential system of government, which significantly increased Mr Erdogan's powers. MEDIA Turkey's airwaves are lively, with hundreds of private TV and radio stations competing with the state broadcaster, TRT. Television is by far the most influential news medium; both press and broadcasting outlets are operating by powerful business operators. For journalists, the military, Kurds and political Islam are highly-sensitive topics, coverage of which can lead to arrest and prosecution. Some of the most repressive restrictions have been lifted on the path to EU entry, but it remains a crime to insult the Turkish nation and president, and a wave of prosecutions of journalists under Recep Tayyip Erdogan has prompted new concern for press freedom. TIMELINE Some key dates in Turkey's history: 1453 - Sultan Mehmed II captures Constantinople, ending Byzantine Empire and consolidating Ottoman Empire in Asia Minor and Balkans. 15th-16th centuries - Expansion into Asia and Africa. 1683 - Ottoman advance into Europe halted at Battle of Vienna. Long decline begins. 1908 - Young Turk Revolution establishes constitutional rule, but degenerates into military dictatorship during First World War, where Ottoman Empire fights in alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary. 1918-22 - Partition of defeated Ottoman Empire leads to eventual triumph of Turkish National Movement in war of independence against foreign occupation and rule of Sultan. 1923 - Turkey declared a republic with Kemal Ataturk as president. Soon afterwards it becomes secular. 1952 - Turkey abandons Ataturk's neutralist policy and joins Nato. 1960 - Army coup against ruling Democratic Party. 1974 - Turkish troops occupy northern Cyprus, partitioning the island. 1984 - Kurdish PKK group launches separatists guerrilla campaign which develops into a major civil war that simmers on for decades. 2011 - Syrian civil war breaks out, resulting in tension along the countries' border and a huge influx of refugees into Turkey. 2016 - Attempted coup fails. 2017 - Referendum approves switch to presidential system."

Prosecutors say the 15-year-old victim was ""scared and coerced"" into sex acts. Shrewsbury Crown Court heard how on one occasion 12 men were waiting, in three or four cars, to have sex with her, and laughed and joked as they did so. Latest news from the West Midlands The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was allegedly first contacted by Hizam, 21, in early 2016. Prosecutor Mark Heywood claimed she told him she was 15, but he persuaded her to go to a hotel in Telford, where they had consensual sex. It is claimed Sulayman, 22, later contacted her through Snapchat, and offered to take her shopping but instead took her to a house in Birmingham where he allegedly raped her and other men had sex with her. He is alleged to have also taken her to the supermarket car park. Judge Peter Barrie warned the jury to hear the case with ""cool-headed and careful assessment"".

uk-england-gloucestershire-21759083,Cirencester Roman cockerel 'best find' in 40 years,"A restored Roman cockerel figurine is the best result from a Cirencester dig in decades, archaeologists have said.","The enamelled object, which dates back as far as AD100, was unearthed during a dig in 2011 at a Roman burial site in the town. It has now returned from conservation work and finders Cotswold Archaeology said it ""looks absolutely fantastic"". The 12.5cm bronze figure was discovered inside a child's grave and is thought to have been a message to the gods. 'Highly prized' It is believed that the Romans gave religious significance to the cockerel which was known to be connected with Mercury. Experts say it was Mercury, a messenger to the gods, that was also responsible for conducting newly-deceased souls to the afterlife. The figurine had to be sent away for conservation work to be carried out which has taken four months to complete. Archaeologist Neil Holbrook, from Cotswold Archaeology, said the work had ""exceeded expectations"", particularly for highlighting its fine enamel detail. ""It reinforces what a fantastic article this is and how highly prized and expensive it must have been,"" he said. ""This must have cost, in current money, thousands of pounds to buy and countless hours to make, and so to actually put this into the grave of a two or three-year-old child is not something that you would do lightly. ""It really shows that this was a very wealthy, important family, and signifies the love that the parents had for the dead child."" The cockerel was found during excavation work at the former Bridges Garage site on Tetbury Road in Cirencester - once the second largest town in Roman Britain. A burial site was unearthed at the site including more than 40 burials and four cremations; something experts said was the largest archaeological find in the town since the 1970s. 'Best ever' This particular figurine is one of only four ever found in Britain, with a total of eight known from the whole of the Roman Empire. Mr Holbrook added: ""Without a doubt this is the best Roman cockerel ever found in Britain. ""This is the best find that I have seen come out of Cirencester in 30 to 40 years and is of national significance."" The object is believed to have been made in northern Britain, with evidence pointing to a workshop in Castleford, West Yorkshire, which made enamel artefacts. Talks are under way for a permanent display of the cockerel, possibly at the Corinium Museum in Cirencester."
uk-northern-ireland-20422820,Prisoners in Roe House at Maghaberry end dirty protest,Republican sources and the prison service have said no deal was done to end a dirty protest by some dissident republican prisoners.,"Twenty-two inmates aligned to a group calling itself the IRA ended their protest over the routine use of strip searching at Maghaberry Prison. Earlier this month, the group murdered prison officer David Black. Members of other dissident groups in Maghaberry were not consulted about the move and remain on protest. In a statement to the Irish News, prisoners on landing four in Roe House said they had taken the decision after ""intense and detailed discussion and analysis"". The protest started in May 2011 in opposition to strip searches. The prisoners claim that the prison authorities reneged on an agreement brokered in August 2010 to end a policy of routine full body searches, replacing it with electronic scanners. The prisoners claim the deal was that they would be searched using a BOSS chair - a Body Orifice Security Scanner. 'Space for resolution' Prison authorities said the agreement was for internal movement within the prison only, not when prisoners left and re-entered their wings for domestic and legal visits or trips to court. Justice Minister David Ford welcomed the move but said the prison service had honoured and upheld its side of the agreement. ""Clearly this now presents the opportunity for a relaxation of tension, particularly if the other group of prisoners were also to move in the same direction,"" he said. The statement said the prisoners on landing four believed the move would ""provide the space required for a resolution of the current impasse"". ""This initiative should be viewed as a genuine and sincere attempt to create the conditions in which a conflict free environment can flourish whereby all are treated with respect and dignity is guaranteed,"" the statement added. Mr Ford said prison authorities were looking at the issue of how prisoners are searched. ""All prisoners in Northern Ireland on entering and leaving prison require to be full body searched - that is being dealt with at the moment by two pilots which are running at Magilligan and Hydebank Wood. ""We are also moving on our proposals for a different type of technology which might be applicable to Maghaberry. ""Following on from the report from the prison review team, the prison service has been actively working to avoid full body searching on the basis that it would be something which would ensure security for prisoners and prison staff, but something which is a lot more dignified to both prisoners and the staff who have to operate it."" The justice minister said there had been no ""concessions made or discussions recently with the prisoners"". ""This is an initiative which has come from them,"" he said. Mr Ford said he did not know if those prisoners still on dirty protest would now choose to end their action. ""There have been two different groups within the separated republican prisoners,"" he said. ""Clearly there are complex relationships within the group of prisoners at Roe House and I'm hoping the group of assessors who have been assisting us in seeking to find a way through the current difficulties may be in a position to produce an assessment as to how the mood is on both landings of the house in the next week or two."" Paul Givan, the chairman of the assembly's justice committee, said republican prisoners were trying to return to the situation in the Maze Prison during the Troubles ""when they ran their own wings"". ""Irrespective of whether there is a protest or not, the current arrangements in Roe House for republican prisoners in Maghaberry are already a step too far and nobody should countenance a return to a Maze-style prison,"" he said. ""The NI Prison Service should outline the status of the prison protest in Roe House and its role in how the current situation has developed."""

But after newspaper reports on Tuesday that the Cameron family might get a cat, the spokesman said there was a ""pro-cat faction within the building"". No decisions have been taken, he added. The Downing Street rat has been seen scuttling outside the door of Number 10 on two TV news bulletins. It was first spotted during a BBC News broadcast by political correspondent Gary O'Donoghue. Stray to stardom It passed behind the railings outside Number 10 during a live report last week. It has since been spied on another TV broadcast from the famous central London street. Asked about the creature during a lobby briefing for Westminster's press pack, the prime minister's official spokesman said there were ""no plans"" to bring in a cat to deal with it. If there is a cat brought in it will be emulating previous famous political felines such as Socks at the White House and Humphrey in Number 10 during the 1990s. Humphrey was adopted after wandering into the building as a stray while Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister in 1989. He moved out six months after Labour's 1997 general election win, with Tony Blair's wife Cherie denying reports her dislike for the animal was to blame. Humphrey died in March 2006 at the home of a civil servant who cared for him during his ""retirement"". The number of rats living across the UK is estimated to be more than 50 million."

There are also mentions of a recruitment freeze and ""imposing"" overtime and part-time working.

He is accused of unauthorised access to computer material and knowingly providing false information to law enforcement agencies in the US. The investigation was a joint operation between UK cybercrime units and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Microsoft and Sony were attacked on Christmas Day, making it difficult for users to log on. The distributed-denial-of-service attack - which floods servers causing them to stop working - caused major disruptions. 'Swatting' The arrest was part of a joint operation between officers from the South East Regional Organised Crime Unit (Serocu) and the North West Regional Crime Unit (Rocu), supported by the National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU). Craig Jones, head of the Cyber Crime Unit at Serocu said: ""This investigation is a good example of joint law enforcement co-operation in relation to a type of criminality that is not restricted by any geographical boundaries. ""We are still at the early stages of the investigation and there is still much work to be done. We will continue to work closely with the FBI to identify those who commit offences and hold them to account."" He explained more about one of the charges, known as swatting. ""Offences referred to as 'swatting' involve law enforcement forces in the United States receiving hoax calls via Skype for a major incident in which Swat teams were dispatched.""

uk-politics-38760718,Donald Trump and Theresa May - Do opposites attract?,"As she made her way across the Atlantic, Theresa May joked with the press pack on her flight that ""sometimes opposites attract"".","Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor@bbclaurakon Twitter A wisecracking way of trying to cover the question about how she and Donald Trump can work together - the reality TV star billionaire and the self-described hard working vicar's daughter. Voters will decide for themselves how funny they find it. But Number 10 has already invested a lot in the early days of this relationship. Perhaps, that is in part due to the early embarrassment of former UKIP leader Nigel Farage's adventures in Manhattan. However, it is also certainly due to her conviction that whoever the US president is, a British leader needs to, and should, cultivate their friendship. Downing Street sources say they have had more contact with the Trump team since its victory than any other country has - and the conversations between the two leaders have focused on how to develop their personal relationship and the bond between the two countries. But even before the two politicians meet tomorrow in the Oval Office, Mrs May is trying to put forward serious arguments about Britain and America's relationship as the world changes at warp speed around the two countries - making a major foreign policy speech at a gathering of the Republican Party in Philadelphia just hours after she touches down. No change on torture It is plain to see that while she is deadly serious about creating an extremely close relationship with the new president, she will continue to disagree with him on some issues. When repeatedly questioned about his view that torture works, the prime minister told us: ""We condemn torture, I have been very clear, I'm not going to change my position whether I'm talking to you or talking to the president."" And crucially, she said guidance stating that UK security services cannot share intelligence if it is obtained through torture will not change, telling me: ""Our guidance is very clear about the position that the UK takes, and our position has not changed."" Despite President Trump's very public doubts about Nato, she says he has already assured her on the phone that he is committed to the alliance. A public restatement of that in the next 24 hours would no doubt be a political boon for her. While the prime minister is plainly uncomfortable with some of Mr Trump's positions, she also wants to emphasise some of the areas where they do agree - the ""shared values"" of looking out for ""ordinary working class families"". In her speech to senators and congressmen tonight she will also emphasise how, in her view, Conservative values are Republican values. The Republicans - the Tories' sister political party - are now in charge at all levels on Capitol Hill, as well as inside the White House. For the GOP and Mrs May's Conservative Party, patriotism, flag and family are not values to shy away from. And despite the squeamishness, even in Tory ranks, about her eagerness to be seen alongside the president, the prime minister is unapologetic about her friendly stance. When asked about appearing to be too close to the controversial new president, she said: ""Donald Trump was elected president of the United States of America. ""The UK and the US have shared challenges, shared interests, that we can work together to deal with. We have a special relationship, it's long standing, it's existed through many different prime ministers and presidents."" A more different prime minister and president are hard to conceive. What they make of each other, and the relationship between our two countries, will affect us all."

It blamed the coronavirus pandemic, as well as ""other factors"". Aberdeen Harbour Board said the procurement process for the remaining 30% of the project was under way. The work is aimed at allowing cruise ships direct access to the site. The expansion would allow the ships to berth alongside the dock, eliminating the need to ferry passengers ashore by small boat. A spokesperson for Dragados said: ""Dragados UK is proud of the progress achieved with this project but the Covid-19 emergency and other factors have meant that our involvement in the project has ended earlier than originally anticipated. ""We wish the project every success as it progresses towards completion."" Michelle Handforth, the board's chief executive, said: ""This year's summer season was of critical importance to the Aberdeen Harbour expansion project, as we endeavoured to complete a series of major construction milestones and continued to address the rock removal challenges first identified in October last year. ""The interruption to the schedule as a result of the Covid-19 emergency has had the effect of greatly compounding those existing challenges. ""It is too early at this stage to confirm what impact this will have on the construction timeline, especially given current Covid-19 restrictions, but the intention for a phased opening, when safe to do so, remains unaffected"". Activity on site is currently restricted due to coronavirus measures. BBC Scotland revealed last week that a new contractor was being sought to complete work, and that talks were ongoing between the harbour board and Dragados. The Scottish government said in a statement: ""We will continue to work with regional partners to ensure the projects within the Aberdeen City Region Deal are delivered and bring about the inclusive and sustainable economic benefits intended."" It emerged in October that completion of the project would be delayed. Initially due this year, it is now due to be finished in 2021."

He defended himself in court, saying he had carried out his activities as a journalist, Iranian media reported. Mr Rezaian could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. He is being tried in one of Tehran's revolutionary courts, usually reserved for political cases or those related to national security. Mr Rezaian appeared in court alongside his wife, Yeganeh Salehi, and a third detainee, reported to be a female photojournalist. The judge, Abolghassem Salavati, outlined the charges against Mr Rezaian as ""espionage through collecting classified information and providing it to hostile governments"" and ""spreading propaganda against the regime"", Iran's Mehr news agency reported. Mr Rezaian rejected some of the charges, Mehr reported, saying: ""I am a journalist and I carried out all my activities legally and as a journalist."" The presiding judge: Abolghassem Salavati The presiding judge, Abolghassem Salavati, is known for handing down harsh sentences and is accused by human rights groups of cracking down on journalists and activists. He has been dubbed the ""judge of death"" for imposing several death sentences after the 2009 post-election opposition protests. He first came to public attention in 2006 when he sentenced two defendants to death for the murder of Hassan Moghadas, the Revolutionary Court judge who sentenced a prominent journalist - Akbar Ganji - to 15 years in jail. Since then, Mr Salavati has presided over or sat in the trials of several prominent political figures, including a daughter of former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani. In January 2009, he found four people guilty of conspiring with the US government against Iran in their work on an HIV prevention programme. In September 2014, Mr Salavati sentenced Mohsen Amir-Aslani to death for heresy for his interpretation of the Jonah and the Whale story as a symbolic tale. Source: BBC Monitoring's Armen Shahbazian What are Iran's revolutionary courts? The US State Department repeated its call for the ""absurd charges"" to be dropped. Iran has not recently commented on the case, but the Washington Post has spoken out forcefully. ""The shameful acts of injustice continue without end in the treatment of [Mr] Rezaian,"" a statement by the newspaper's Executive Editor Martin Baron said on Monday. ""Now we learn his trial will be closed to the world. And so it will be closed to the scrutiny it fully deserves. ""There is no justice in this system, not an ounce of it, and yet the fate of a good, innocent man hangs in the balance."" The paper points out that Mr Rezaian was arrested without charge and jailed in Iran's notorious Evin prison - placed in isolation for many months and denied medical care he needed. His brother, Ali, meanwhile told the BBC there was no evidence to support the charges: ""They've cherry-picked information to come up with whatever they could to charge him with to make it seem like there was a reason that they've held him."" Sensitive timing The BBC's US state department correspondent, Barbara Plett Usher, says US officials have repeatedly raised his case during months of nuclear negotiations with Iran, but have declined to link the two. The imprisoned journalist's family have taken heart from recent comments by President Barack Obama, who said that the White House would not rest until Mr Rezaian was brought home safely, our correspondent adds. The case is all the more sensitive because it has unfolded during negotiations between Iran and the West over the country's nuclear programme. Some analysts have suggested the arrest was related to internal power struggles in Iran over the outcome of the talks. Iran and six major world powers, including the US, have set a 30 June deadline for a conclusive nuclear deal to end a 10-year impasse. Mr Rezaian had been the Washington Post's Tehran bureau chief since 2012. His wife, Yeganeh Salehi, was arrested alongside him in July but later bailed after spending two and a half months in custody. It is not clear when the next trial session will be held."

The Saltdean Lido Community Interest Company (CIC) has been granted a 60-year lease to operate the pool by Brighton and Hove City Council. The 1930s art deco structure is the UK's only Grade II*-listed lido. The lido is to be restored by Sir Terence Conran's design firm after it won a competitive tender in which a number of companies submitted proposals. The grant of £439,800 will be used to restore the main swimming pool, install a new plant room, landscape the grounds and for temporary changing rooms and toilets.

According to US media, no Eagles players knelt on the field in protest during the previous season. Speaking before the third game of the final tournament, Cleveland Cavaliers forward James said: ""That's typical of [Mr Trump]. I mean, I know no matter who wins this series, no-one wants the invite anyway."" ""Let's not let someone uninviting you from their house take away from their championship. ""Winning a championship is way bigger than getting invited to the White House, especially with him in it."" The customary honour for championship-winning US teams has been carried out by presidents for decades. Mr Trump's cancellation comes nine months after California's Golden State Warriors basketball team was uninvited from visiting the White House after their NBA victory. ""I agree with Bron,"" Stephen Curry, the star of the Golden State Warriors said on Tuesday. ""Pretty sure the way we handled things last year, we'd stay consistent with that,"" he added, in the event that his team wins. Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said Mr Trump's cancellation was ""not surprising"". ""I think the president has made it clear he's going to try to divide us - all of us - in this country for political gain. That's just the way it is. ""I think we all look forward to the day when we can go back to just having a celebration of athletic achievement and celebrate Americans for their achievement, their good deeds."" ""So it will be nice when we can just get back to normal in three years,"" he said in a statement. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said Mr Trump's decision ""only proves that our president is not a true patriot, but a fragile egomaniac."""
uk-england-south-yorkshire-50123814,Yorkshire Wildlife Park's last rescued brown bear dies,The last of four endangered bears rehomed in Yorkshire after being rescued from Japan has died.,"Ussuri brown bears Riku, Kai, Hanako and Amu were flown over 5,400 miles in August 2018 after being found in cramped conditions at a museum. Hanako, the oldest bear at 27, was put to sleep on Saturday, the Yorkshire Wildlife Park said. All four bears had significant health problems when they arrived in the UK from Tokyo. Amu was put to sleep in August 2018, and Kai and Riku in September and October this year. Kai and Riku who were aged 17 when they arrived and Hanako and Amu were 27. In August 2018 shortly after they arrived vets examining Amu found chronic degenerative diseases which were ""worse than first thought"" and the bear was put to sleep. The Yorkshire Wildlife Park said on Monday it was deeply saddened by Hanako's death. The park, near Doncaster, said: ""Hanako, the last and oldest of the Ussuri brown bears rescued from Japan, has died. ""Hanako arrived at the park with a variety of health problems due to the many years she spent in poor conditions in a museum in Japan. ""When they [bears] arrived, they had problems with their teeth, malnourishment, joint and limb problems and they were underweight. ""Hanako also had specialist ophthalmic care for eye problems. ""Sadly, after the recurrence of stomach problems and several fits, the park vets made the decision to put her to sleep. ""A post mortem will be carried out."" The bears were flown to London from Tokyo and then transferred to the park in an operation it described as ""like clockwork"". They were being kept at the Ainu Cultural Museum on the island of Hokkaido when they came to the attention of animal charity Wild Welfare. The Ussuri brown bear, also known as the black grizzly, can weigh up to 86 stone (550kg) and live up to 35 years. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

health-32024158,DNA of 'an entire nation' assessed,"The genetic code of ""an entire nation"" has effectively been deduced, say researchers in Iceland.","By James GallagherHealth editor, BBC News website The feat was performed by combining DNA data with family trees. The team say they could now find every woman at high-risk of breast cancer ""at the touch of a button"" and it would be ""criminal"" not to use the information. The reports, published in the journal Nature Genetics, used the data to make a suite of discoveries including the age of the last common ancestor of men. DNA is passed from one generation to the next. If you knew everything about the DNA of a child and their grandparents, you could figure out a lot about about the DNA of the parents too. The deCODE genetics team has taken the whole genome sequence of 10,000 people and combined it with nation-wide family trees. ""By using these tricks we can predict, with substantial accuracy, the genome of the entire nation,"" the chief executive of deCODE, Dr Kari Stefansson told the BBC News website. Medicine Mutations in the BRCA genes lead to a much higher lifetime risk of cancer and led the Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie to have her breasts and ovaries removed. Dr Stefansson argued: ""We could, in Iceland, at the push of a button find all women who carry mutations in the BRCA2 gene. ""This risk could basically be nullified by preventative mastectomies and ovariectomies. It would be criminal not to take advantage of it and I am convinced that my fellow countrymen will begin to use it pretty soon."" The data is all anonymous at the moment. Using such data in medicine would raise ethical issues, including identifying deadly disease genes in people who never volunteered their own DNA for study. Dr Stefansson says there is a lot of debate still to come ""but I'm just an old-fashioned physician, my gut instinct is simply to go to these people and warn them"". He is already in discussions with the Icelandic healthcare system. Elegant The 100,000 genomes project in England and President Obama's Precision Medicine Initiative both aim to use such genetic information to revolutionise medicine. Professor Mark Caulfield, the chief scientist at Genomics England, said the studies were ""very interesting"" and ""very elegant"". He told the BBC: ""The team in Iceland is to be congratulated as it has continued, over many years, to contribute to an understanding of the genetic information of disease by looking at the level of the population."" He said the progress being made around the world showed: ""We are on the cusp on the application of transformative genomic medicine at scale"" However, he cautioned that there were many types of BRCA2 mutation and it was important to be certain they were relevant before informing women. Common dad The project made a series of other discoveries including a new gene linked to Alzheimer's disease. The team has calculated a new estimate for the last common ancestor of all men by looking at the rate of mutation in the male Y-chromosome. They believe the last common ancestor was 239,000 years ago - down from a previous estimate of 308,000 years ago. They discovered that in Iceland that 8% of the population is missing all copies of a gene. This could be harmful, beneficial or have no impact at all. The Icelandic group is starting a study to assess the health of these people. Dr Susan Wallace, who worked with the Nuffield Council of Bioethics on a report on the use of biomedical data, said: ""It sounds like a very exciting study and could bring health benefits to people. ""The concerns are that the data is going to be made public, anonymity technically promises protection, but you can be re-identified in datasets. ""There are also concerns of commercial interests in the use of these databases, so there are a lot of concerns that need to be addressed. ""There needs to be more engagement I think."""
health-21965092,Bacteria find 'key to treating obesity without surgery',"Weight loss after gastric band surgery may be partly caused by changes to micro-organisms that live in the gut, say US researchers.","A study in mice has shown that surgery causes different types of bacteria to colonise the gut. Transferring samples of those bacteria into healthy mice caused them to rapidly lose weight without surgery. But the Harvard University researchers said they could not yet explain the mechanism behind their results. There are differences in the bacteria in the stomachs and intestines of obese people compared with those who are of a normal weight. And in people who have had gastric bypass operations to help them lose weight, the types of microbes that are found in the gut change. In the latest study, researchers compared three groups of obese mice on a high-calorie diet. A week later the mice who had undergone the real obesity surgery had different bacteria in their guts, with an increase in types usually seen in lean individuals and a drop in types associated with obesity. Three weeks after surgery they had lost about 30% of their bodyweight, the researchers reported in Science Translational Medicine. There was little change in micro-organisms present in the mice who had had sham operations, even though the group on the low-calorie diet lost just as much weight as the mice who had had the bypass surgery. Metabolism impact Researchers then transferred samples from the guts of the three groups of mice into other germ-free mice. Those who received bacteria from the bypass mice, lost a significant amount of weight in two weeks but the others saw no change. It is not yet clear how the microbes influence weight loss, but one theory is that they have an impact on metabolism. ""We need to learn a good deal more about the mechanism by which a microbial population changed by gastric bypass exerts its effects,"" said study author Dr Lee Kaplan, an associate professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School. ""The ability to achieve even some of these effects without surgery would give us an entirely new way to treat the critical problem of obesity, one that could help patients unable or unwilling to have surgery."" Co-author Peter Turnbaugh added: ""It may not be that we will have a magic pill that will work for everyone who's slightly overweight. ""But if we can, at a minimum, provide some alternative to gastric bypass surgery that produces similar effects, it would be a major advance."" Prof David Haslam, from the National Obesity Forum, said: ""We know the effects of bariatric surgery are not just mechanical and we don't know the full reasons why it works so well, especially in the resolution of diabetes. ""There is more to it than meets the eye."""
uk-wales-politics-15891842,Welsh budget: Labour and Lib Dems reach agreement,Labour and the Liberal Democrats have agreed a deal over the Welsh government's £14.5bn budget.,"It includes an extra £20m to spend on the education of the poorest pupils. The minority Labour administration in Cardiff Bay has been talking to opposition parties in an attempt to get its spending plans approved. First Minister Carwyn Jones and Welsh Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams hailed the deal, but it was criticised by the Conservatives and Plaid Cymru. 'No cuts' The first minister said other budget areas would not be cut to pay for the agreement. Mr Jones told BBC Radio Wales: ""There are no other budget areas that would be cut. We have looked at a number of areas where the money can be gathered. ""This is about as much as we can manage, but it's money that is going to be used for a good purpose in order to provide better educational opportunities for some of our most deprived children."" The extra money boosts the size of a pupil deprivation grant to more than £32m next year. A Welsh government spokesman said it would mean £450 would go directly to schools for every child receiving free school meals. There were 70,800 children entitled to free school meals in Wales last year. The two parties have also agreed on the destination of a £39m windfall which the Welsh government received as a result of a council tax freeze in England. To be spent over two years, it includes more money for businesses that recruit young apprentices and capital spending for a home energy efficiency scheme. The agreement breaks weeks of deadlock in budget talks between Labour and the opposition. With 30 of the Senedd's 60 seats, Labour needed at least one opposition member to ratify its budget. Ministers had also been talking to Plaid Cymru, who called for increased spending to boost the economy. The government had until Tuesday to table a final budget before a crucial vote on 6 December. A Welsh government source indicated that Wales could receive a spending boost as a consequence of the Chancellor's autumn statement on Tuesday. Any additional funds would be spent ""in consultation"" with the Lib Dems. 'Make a difference' Welsh Lib Dem leader Mrs Williams said the money - which the party has dubbed a pupil premium - would start to break a link between poverty and poor standards in schools. She said: ""It would have been easier politically to walk away, but the Welsh Liberal Democrats have instead worked with our political opponents to agree a budget for the good of Wales. ""We are proud that our influence will make a difference to children in Wales and provide a welcome boost to the economic recovery."" Plaid Cymru said the Lib-Lab deal was ""bad news for the Welsh economy"". ""There will not be, it seems, a package of emergency measures to stimulate the economy because the Lib Dems have sold their support very cheaply,"" a spokesman said. The Conservatives wanted to see an increase in health spending. Tory opposition leader Andrew RT Davies said: ""What is regrettably clear is the Liberal Democrats' endorsement of Labour's savage cuts to the NHS. ""It is unfortunate that, while their Westminster colleagues protect the health budget in England, the Welsh Liberal Democrats have chosen not to prioritise the NHS in Wales."""
uk-england-42808302,Plastic bottles: Free water refill points rolled out to cut waste,"Shops, cafes and businesses will offer free water refill points in every major city and town in England by 2021.","Industry body Water UK says its scheme could cut disposable plastic bottle use by tens of millions a year. The move comes amid growing concern about the effect of plastic waste on the environment. Whitbread, which owns Costa Coffee and Premier Inn, is the first to sign up to the initiative and will provide water in all of its branches from March 2018. Refill stations and public fountains will be able to be found via an app or window signs pointing people in the direction of the nearest one. The new scheme has been set up on the back of a previous initiative, the Refill campaign, which currently has more than 1,600 refill stations across the UK and operates in 13 towns and cities in England. Water companies already taking part in local schemes under Refill include Anglian Water in Norwich, Northumbrian Water in Durham, South West Water in Cornwall and Bristol Water in Bristol. 'Make refilling easy' In 2015, Bristol adopted the campaign and the city now has more than 200 points. It is estimated that if every city resident in Bristol refilled one bottle once a week, the city could cut the use of disposable bottles by 22.3 million a year. In December, London mayor Sadiq Khan pledged to create 20 new fountains and other bottle-refill points in the city. Water UK's chief executive, Michael Roberts, said the industry wants to tackle the problems caused by plastic bottle and ""help turn this harmful tide of plastic waste"". ""This country has some of the best drinking water in the world and we want everyone to benefit from it. ""This scheme will do that by making it easier for people to refill their bottles wherever they work, rest, shop or play."" The issue of plastic waste has also been highlighted by the BBC's Blue Planet II. Analysis by BBC Reality Check Making it easier for people to refill water bottles instead of buying single-use ones is squarely on the agenda, with support from Environment Secretary Michael Gove and the Mayor of London. But there are no figures to show how many working drinking fountains there are across the UK. Installing them is a local responsibility. The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England and Wales, says it doesn't hold data on the number of drinking fountains. Water UK, which will run the free water refill scheme, also could not provide figures. The Drinking Fountain Association, founded as the Metropolitan Drinking Fountain and Cattle Trough Association in 1959, owns 2,406 fountains in England, but the vast majority of these aren't working fountains - they are historic monuments. Hundreds of drinking fountains were installed in the Victorian times to promote public health - and as part of the temperance movement, with many being stationed outside pubs. The advent of bottled water in the 1980s among other things pushed the need for drinking fountains down council priority lists."
health-35596991,"NHS trusts may hit £2.3bn deficit, report warns","NHS trusts in England are on course to be £2.3bn in the red by the end of the financial year, according to a leading health think tank.","By Adam BrimelowHealth correspondent, BBC News Based on data from about one in three trusts, the King's Fund said the financial position was getting worse and performance was deteriorating. It said this year was shaping up to be ""make or break"" for the NHS in England. The Department of Health said the service, despite being very busy, was performing well. This report - based on health service data and feedback from finance directors at about one in three trusts - offers a gloomy prognosis for the NHS. Three months ago, the King's Fund thought the overspend for trusts in this financial year in England could top £2bn. Now it is forecasting a net deficit of £2.3bn by the end of March. The findings suggest two-thirds of trusts expect to overspend by the end of the year, including 89% of acute hospital trusts. Sceptical about savings A clear majority of finance directors from trusts and local commissioning groups were sceptical that the health service in England could meet annual efficiency savings of 2-3% up to 2020-21, as required by the NHS masterplan known as the Five Year Forward View. One area that has been identified for savings is spending on agency staff. Last year, the Department of Health imposed a cap, but more than half of finance directors (53%) were concerned they would not be able to meet these limits. More than 20% thought the cap would affect their ability to recruit in order to provide safe care. The report highlights increasing concerns about the quality of services. A majority of the trust finance directors who responded - 53% - thought things had got worse in the last year. They were particularly worried about delays in A&E. Many also expressed concern about delayed transfers of care and staff morale. 'Increasing concerns' Commenting on the findings, the King's Fund's chief economist, Prof John Appleby, said they showed the NHS faced a huge financial challenge. ""Even with the additional funding recently provided by the Treasury and a big switch from capital to revenue spending, it is touch and go whether the Department of Health will be able to balance its budget at the end of the year. ""At the same time, performance is deteriorating with key targets being missed with increasing regularity and increasing concerns being raised about the quality of patient care. This is shaping up to be a make-or-break year for the NHS."" Health Minister Alistair Burt said: ""There should never be a choice between providing safe care - our top priority - and balancing the books, which is why we're investing £10bn to fund the NHS's own plan for the future, including nearly £4bn next year. ""Despite being busy, the NHS continues to perform well - last year the service performed 1.6 million more operations and treated 2,100 more people every day within the four-hour A&E target compared to 2010."""
entertainment-arts-21365281,Digital music 'becomes mainstream' in the UK,"The inexorable rise of digital music, blamed by many for the collapse of high street retailer HMV, continues unabated in the UK, according to new figures.","Almost one in five consumers (19.6%) now prefers to buy all their music as downloads, says trade body the BPI. Last year, 27.7% of UK music fans purchased downloads from stores such as iTunes or Amazon; or streamed songs on services like Spotify or YouTube. Gotye's Somebody That I Used To Know was the most-streamed song of 2012. It was closely followed by Carly Rae Jepsen's Call Me Maybe - with more than 3.7 billion tracks streamed in the UK in 2012, or 140 per household. The streaming market is now worth £49m to record labels. Spotify leads the field in terms of brand awareness, with figures revealing almost 70% of all consumers to be familiar with the Swedish service. According to the BPI, four out of five of consumers have heard of at least one of the leading audio streaming services. Spotify's own research shows Edinburgh to be the UK's top city for streaming in terms of per-capita usage, followed by Cardiff and Southampton. On the release of the BPI's Digital Music Nation report, its chief executive, Geoff Taylor, said there had ""rightly"" been ""a lot of focus in the past few weeks on High Street music retail"".

business-51055491,What has Donald Trump actually achieved on trade?,"Is Donald Trump anything more than, as he once put it, ""Tariff Man""?","The US president uses the tool against trading partners to fight battles from ""unfair"" steel price practices to France's digital tax on tech giants. Most prominent has been his trade war with China which has raised border taxes on almost $500bn of annual trade. Mr Trump styles himself as a deal-maker who, as president of the world's largest economy, uses tariffs for leverage in negotiations. So can the US president legitimately claim he has made any progress? The BBC takes a look around the world. China When Mr Trump first announced a trade deal with China, he hailed it as ""very large and comprehensive"". It was, he tweeted, ""by far, the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country"". This week, the two sides finally got around to a signing a deal but some were far from convinced that the substance merited Mr Trump's descriptions. Most of the tariffs remain in place. The US will maintain levies of up to 25% on an estimated $360bn worth of Chinese goods while China is expected to keep tariffs on more than $100bn of US imports. Even the Trump administration conceded it fell short of original goals, describing it as a ""phase one"" agreement. North America In 2018, the US, Canada and Mexico agreed to a deal that will govern the more than $1.1 trillion in trade between the three countries. The pact, which has been slowly making its way through the legislatures of the three countries, will replace the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which Mr Trump has described as the ""worst"". However, despite a name change, a lot of the terms remain the same. There are some differences, including stronger labour provisions and tougher rules on the sourcing of auto parts. But analysts say their significance remains to be seen. Many of the other updates were worked out in negotiations that pre-dated Mr Trump. Japan and South Korea One of Mr Trump's first moves as president was to withdraw the US from the Trans Pacific Partnership - a proposed 12-country deal that eventually went ahead without America, putting its exports at a disadvantage. Mr Trump has since claimed two bilateral agreements in Asia, with Japan and South Korea, but the changes were so limited that Congressional researchers said they barely qualified as trade deals. In the case of South Korea, the most notable provision actually preserved US tariffs on light duty trucks. With Japan, the US won either levy cuts or complete elimination on $7bn worth of agricultural goods. But this was the same access America would have received under the Trans Pacific Partnership. Europe In the case of Europe, there is no trade deal in sight. The two sides went through a round of tit-for-tat tariffs after the US announced the steel and aluminium tariffs - measures that affect more than $10bn worth of two-way trade. Then, in October, the US imposed 25% tariffs on $7.5bn worth of European goods, including Scotch whisky, French wine and Italian cheese. In that instance, Mr Trump's decision had the approval of the World Trade Organization, which had found that the European Union provided illegal subsidies to aircraft manufacturer Airbus. The US president had made repeated threats to impose tariffs on European cars but that has never materialised. However, the White House continues to dangle the prospect of steep levies on other EU goods such as French produce in retaliation for France's new digital services tax.. Brazil and Argentina Heads spun last month when Mr Trump announced on Twitter he wanted tariffs on steel and aluminium from Brazil and Argentina. Those countries had been exempted from higher duty on both metals but Mr Trump claimed the two nations had been devaluing their currencies ""which is not good for our farmers"". So far, there has been no follow-up announcement from his administration and the threats have not materialised. Following a phone call with Mr Trump, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said he had been assured they would not happen."

Last month, the Competition and Market Authority (CMA) ruled it should stop in six months as current competition on the ferry route was unsustainable. The case is expected to be heard by the Competition Appeal Tribunal in the autumn. MyFerryLink said a judgment would then be made towards the end of the year or early in 2015. Eurotunnel bought three ships from SeaFrance after it went bust in 2012, with MyFerryLink operating up to 24 daily crossings on the Dover-Calais route. The CMA said this meant it had more than half the market when its rail link was taken into consideration.

An order giving Eurotunnel six months to stop running services has now been put on hold pending the outcome of the appeal."
world-europe-43828580,Salisbury attack: Scientist Vladimir Uglev 'helped create Novichok',Moscow continues to deny the existence of a chemical weapons programme called Novichok. But this is a question of semantics.,"By Steven RosenbergBBC News On Russia's Black Sea coast I meet Vladimir Uglev, a scientist who helped develop nerve agents for the Soviet Union. ""The aim of the programme was to produce a substance far more powerful than the nerve agent VX - 10 times more powerful,"" he tells me. ""And that's what we got."" Mr Uglev, 71, claims he created the poison that was used in the attack on Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury on 4 March. It has been identified in Russia by the code A-234. ""I can tell by the mass spectrometry readings, the presence of fluorine, by its molecular weight, and from all the spectrum data I was sent recently."" But if the nerve agent was so powerful, how did the Skripals survive? Vladimir believes they received a ""small dose… close to the threshold level."" Earlier this week the UK revealed the poison was delivered ""in liquid form"". I ask Vladimir: if the nerve agent used in Salisbury was the one he synthesised, does the poisoning prey on his conscience? ""These are not the first victims on my conscience,"" he tells me. ""If I thought about it, I could probably count a dozen people who've been poisoned by our substances, in different circumstances, for example, at the military training ground. Then there was the case of scientist Andrei Zheleznyakov who got infected in the laboratory."" Vladimir Uglev worked at a state laboratory in Shikhany, in Russia's Saratov region. One day he himself was involved in an accident with a novichok. ""It was with 'novichok' A-240. The solvent boiled over and splashed on to my right hand. I put my hand into hydrochloric acid, then washed it with an alkaline peroxide solution and put it under the tap."" ""You could say the Skripals and I are baptised by the same novichok, except that in my case it was A-240, not A-234. But it was my substance. And judging by how pure their test sample proved to be, this may well have been from a batch made by my own hands. It has a long shelf life, and virtually no expiry date."" The Russian state continues to insist it is innocent; that accusations against it over the Salisbury poisoning are part of a ""Russophobic"" plot and a ""provocation"" by Britain and America. Yulia Skripal, 33, was discharged from hospital in Salisbury earlier this month and her 66-year-old father is no longer in a critical condition. Officials say the highest concentration of the Novichok agent was found at their house. Moscow maintains there is no evidence that it targeted the Skripals. ""It's absolutely right,"" Vladimir Uglev tells me. ""You will never prove Russia's guilt. Unless you can find the actual test tube that contained the actual poison."" ""But the logic of events suggests it was Russia, as does the way our leaders reacted. They were so quick to say 'It wasn't us!' It's like when a thief steals something at the market: he's the first to shout 'The thief's not here, he's over there! Catch him!'"" Is Vladimir Uglev surprised that his country stands accused of carrying out a chemical attack in the UK? ""Not really,"" he tells me. ""And it's not Putin who is to blame. All of us in Russia are at fault. If this is what our country is like, what has Putin got to do with it? Replace Putin with Margaret Thatcher, and do you think anything would change? It wouldn't. The problem is that our society doesn't want to change."""

Earlier this month the Cabinet Office described the posts as ""sickening"", but said the length of time since the edits - made in 2009 and 2012 - would make it very difficult to identify the offending civil servants.

The most positive results reveal that there has been a ""significant"" boost in numbers around Aberdeen. Red squirrels are also starting to appear in previously abandoned areas. Conservation officer Mary-Anne Collis said: ""In the central lowlands, red squirrels are holding their ground and as a result we've started to see them in areas where they haven't been seen for a long time. ""This is particularly noticeable to the south and east of Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park, which is now predominantly a red-only zone. ""If it wasn't for our fantastic volunteers that brave the unpredictable spring weather to help us with these surveys then we wouldn't be able to see the positive impact that our conservation work is having."" Grey squirrels, which were introduced to Britain from North America in the 19th Century, out-compete red squirrels for resources. They can also carry squirrelpox, a virus that does not harm them but is deadly to reds. Since 2011, Saving Scotland's Red Squirrels has been monitoring populations in the parts of the country where the rodents are most under threat from non-native greys. Rarely seen Numbers are surveyed using feeder boxes placed in the same areas of woodland each spring. When a squirrel visits a feeder box, a sticky tab collects some of its hair, which can then be identified under a microscope. Despite most areas successfully maintaining population levels, southern parts of Scotland saw mixed results. The survey produced no positive results in Berwickshire, where reds are now very rarely seen. Project manager Dr Mel Tonkin said: ""Unfortunately red squirrel numbers have continued to fall in parts of the Scottish Borders, especially since the arrival in Berwickshire of the deadly Squirrelpox virus from south of the border in 2011. ""In Dumfries and Galloway, red squirrels continue to do well, but are threatened by increasing records of grey squirrels which appear to be spreading into Nithsdale from the east and north. ""It is vital that the work we do here is stepped up to make sure these red squirrel populations remain healthy."" There are an estimated 138,000 red squirrels in the UK, according to Trees for Life."

Regulators are scrutinising this deal due to worries over the level of influence it would give media companies controlled by the Murdoch family within the UK media landscape, as well as concerns over 21st Century Fox's commitment to broadcasting standards. Media analyst Claire Enders, founder of Enders Analysis, said the reported interest of Disney in Fox was ""very credible"". Ms Enders said for a ""huge conglomerate"" like Disney, a deal focused on consolidation would be ""very sensible"", and allow it to save hundreds of millions of dollars though ""combined efficiencies"". But she said the talks would not be able to progress significantly ahead of a critical auction of UK Premier League rights early next year, which would potentially affect Sky's valuation. A Disney deal is not expected to prevent Fox's pursuit of the rest of Sky's shares. The takeover discussions come against the backdrop of upheaval in the media industry, as viewers turn increasingly towards online video, and away from subscriptions for pay-TV. This shift is reportedly what has fuelled Disney's approach; combining Disney's extensive entertainment offering with Fox's, might be a way to counter the growing threat from Amazon and Netflix. US cable group Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, and telecoms operator Verizon are also reported to have expressed interest in Fox's entertainment assets. Analysts say changing consumer habits have also prompted media and entertainment executives to explore more consolidation of content creation and distribution functions."

Smith and professional partner Aliona Vilani earned a perfect score of 40 points from the judges for their quickstep to Jingle Bells. They won after the judges' and studio audience's scores were combined. Smith competed against other contestants from previous series - Rachel Stevens, Lisa Riley, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Chris Hollins and Russell Grant. The 25-year-old said of his win: ""It's a nice present, I am not going to lie! We've had such a fun time although the first week of rehearsals was hard. ""But since then we have just been chilling out, laughing and giggling, messing around on the dance floor, it's been really good fun."" The contestants and judges adopted the roles of pantomime characters. Sir Bruce, who stepped down as the regular weekly host of the programme this year, came back to present the show with Tess Daly and also sang a version of Winter Wonderland."
world-us-canada-56222317,Doctor joins Zoom court hearing while operating on patient,"A doctor in Sacramento, California joined a traffic court hearing on Zoom while performing surgery on a patient.","Scott Green was dressed in surgical scrubs in an operating theatre when he appeared at his virtual trial on Thursday, the Sacramento Bee reported. When questioned by the judge, Mr Green said he was happy to go ahead, and that he had ""another surgeon right here who's doing the surgery with me"". The judge said that would not be ""appropriate"" and postponed the trial. The Medical Board of California has now said in a statement that it would look into the incident, adding that it ""expects physicians to follow the standard of care when treating their patients"". Before the Sacramento Superior Court hearing, which was livestreamed on YouTube, a court clerk asked the plastic surgeon: ""Hello, Mr Green? Hi. Are you available for trial? It kind of looks like you're in an operating room."" Green responded: ""I am, sir. Yes, I'm in an operating room right now. Yes, I'm available for trial. Go right ahead."" The clerk told Mr Green that the hearing was being livestreamed online, because traffic hearings are required by law to be open to the public. At the same time, an officer summoned to appear in court raised her eyebrows. While waiting for the judge, Court Commissioner Gary Link, to enter the Zoom, Mr Green appeared to continue operating on the patient. Once Mr Link had joined, he told the hearing: ""So unless I'm mistaken, I'm seeing a defendant that's in the middle of an operating room appearing to be actively engaged in providing services to a patient. Is that correct, Mr Green? Or should I say Dr Green?"" After the surgeon confirmed he was in the middle of performing surgery, and that he would be happy to continue, Mr Link said: ""I do not feel comfortable for the welfare of a patient if you're in the process of operating that I would put on a trial, notwithstanding the fact the officer is here today."" Mr Green then insisted he was able to go ahead, adding: ""I have another surgeon right here who's doing the surgery with me, so I can stand here and allow them to do the surgery also."" Mr Link replied: ""I don't think so, I don't think that's appropriate. I'm going to come up with a different date - when you're not actively involved or participating and attending to the needs of a patient."" BBC News has contacted Mr Green's office for comment. The surgeon reportedly told NBC News: ""That's not accurate and I have nothing to say. Thank you."" This isn't the first Zoom court mishap to go viral. Earlier this month, a lawyer was unable to remove a cat filter from his screen, before telling the judge he was happy to go ahead anyway: ""I'm here live, I'm not a cat."""

The man was arrested on Thursday at a property in Connaught Road. Police said other arrests had been made this week in connection with gun-related crime in the town. A spokesman said officers had also executed further warrants and recovered drugs, a firearm and ammunition. A handgun was recovered on Wednesday after being found dumped in brambles in Hayling Drive by litter pickers. The weapon is now being examined to see if it can be matched to any recent shootings. On Wednesday, a man and woman, both aged 29, were arrested in Dale Road and a large quantity of what is believed to be Class A drugs and cash were recovered. A 32-year-old man was also arrested at an address in Five Springs on Thursday morning on suspicion of the cultivation of cannabis. 'Relentless pursuit' Det Ch Insp Dave Quarmby said the force was ""relentless in its pursuit of those committing violent crime"". ""However, in order to turn these arrests into convictions we need key witnesses to be brave and give us statements,"" he said. ""We have measures in place that can protect witnesses but we need to know who you are if we are to help you."" Bedfordshire Police and Crime Commissioner Olly Martins said last week's verdict in the trial of Kyle Beckford showed the ""vital role courageous members of the public can and must continue to play"".

uk-england-merseyside-19948152,Anfield revamp welcomed by Liverpool fans and residents,Residents and fans say they need to be involved in plans to expand Liverpool's stadium and redevelop the Anfield area.,"The joint move, announced by the club and Liverpool City Council, will see capacity rise to 60,000, a number of streets demolished and homes refurbished. The redeveloped Anfield will be the centrepiece of the council's £175m regeneration project of the L4 area. A public consultation will be held, with work scheduled to begin in 2014. Alan Blundell, chair of the Walton Breck Road Residents' Association, who lives on the Skerries Road side of the ground, welcomed the proposals which could see hundreds of Anfield homes renovated. ""As a resident I am very pleased,"" he said. But he added that residents on streets including Lothair Road, Alroy Road and Sybil Road, which are due to be cleared, must be kept informed and consulted every step of the way. ""We have got a new school, medical centre, housing; the main thing is we have got to involve the community at all stages,"" said Mr Blundell. He also said that any residents who faced Compulsory Purchase Orders (CPO) must be offered a fair price for their homes. ""We've had many false dawns before, I'm just hoping now this is the actual one they'll go with. ""The uncertainty has been the problem, it affects the whole area."" It has been 10 years since initial plans were announced to build a new home for the football club on Stanley Park. 'Football quarter' Paul Martin of fans' union Spirit of Shankly said supporters always wanted the club to remain at Anfield. But he added: ""There are a lot more details to be ironed out and we will only really believe it when the team is running onto the pitch."" Mr Martin said his group also believe that a ""football quarter"" should be created around the refurbished ground with bars and places to eat. The council has secured a £25m grant to regenerate the wider area, alongside social landlord Your Housing. Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said: ""What I want is a regenerated Anfield to create employment opportunities and business opportunities for that area."" Liverpool FC managing director Ian Ayre said: ""Any final decision depends on home owners being supportive of the proposed stadium extension."" He added: ""There's a lot of wounds to heal because the way the residents have been treated over many years has perhaps not been acceptable."" The proposal to expand the current 45,276 capacity stadium is expected to cost the club about £150m with Liverpool committing to building a hotel. Redevelopment is likely to see extensions to the Main Stand and the Anfield Road end. A planning application is not expected to be submitted until next summer."

uk-england-london-56497397,London elections 2021: What does the London Assembly do?,"The Greater London Authority is the top of the food chain in London politics. It is made up of the mayor of London and the London Assembly members. We have covered the mayor's role , but what can the London Assembly do?","By Sam FrancisBBC News, London Based at City Hall, for now, the London Assembly is composed of 25 members, elected at the same time as the mayor. Membership of the London Assembly is actually split in two - with 14 representing constituencies representing two boroughs, and the other 11 are elected by a party-list system. The salary of an Assembly Member (AM) is currently £58,543 per year, while higher salaries for those holding key roles. Assembly Members who also work as MPs receive a two-thirds abatement to their salary. The key role of the assembly is to hold the mayor to account. But what powers do members have to do this? Blocking budgets The main power of the assembly lies in passing or rejecting the mayor's budget. In order to spend the £17bn budget, the mayor of London must get his spending plans approved by the London Assembly. To reject the budget, two-thirds of the London Assembly must vote against it. This has never been done. Assembly members are also allowed to propose amendments to the budget, but this again needs a two-thirds majority to be accepted. Committees The London Assembly has several committees which scrutinise the mayor's key powers, such as the transport committee and police and crime committee. But it has no power to change the mayor's decisions in any of these areas. Instead, it checks if policies are working and lead inquiries into major events. This mirrors the committee system in the houses of parliament. While the committees cannot make the mayor change his mind, their findings can often influence decision making. The results of these inquiries are public and many require a response from the mayor. Reports by committees provide the public with detailed analysis of decisions which affect Londoners. Questioning the mayor The mayor and their officials must answer questions put to them by London Assembly members. These questions can either be put in writing, or in person during 10 Mayor's Question Time sessions a year and full meetings of the London Assembly. Through these questions, the London Assembly gets greater details on how the capital is being run. Confirmation hearings The assembly can hold confirmation hearings for the mayor's pick for some of City Hall's top jobs. Proposed candidates for jobs such as Chair of Transport for London must attend the hearings and answer questions from assembly members. The mayor cannot grant the job until the end of the confirmation process. But ultimately the mayor can choose to ignore any recommendations from the assembly on who they hire. London experts The London Assembly is perhaps best viewed as a pool of London experts who try to influence the running and administration of the city. Many have worked their way up through local council politics or run businesses and charities in London. Some London Assembly members become MPs, like James Cleverly, Kemi Badenoch and David Lammy. Some go the other way like Andrew Dismore, the former MP for Hendon who has been a London Assembly member since 2012. Related Internet Links London Elects The London Assembly"
uk-wales-53653235,Coronavirus: Are people wearing face masks on public transport?,"Wearing face masks on public transport is not being enforced strongly enough, according to a coronavirus survivor.","Wayne Withers, 50, of Mountain Ash, Rhondda Cynon Taff, is refusing to use public transport because of large numbers of people ""ignoring"" the rules. Face coverings are now compulsory on trains and buses in Wales. Transport for Wales said staff were turning away passengers who do not have masks but bus company First Cymru said drivers would ""avoid"" refusing travel. For Mr Withers, the reality of coronavirus is all too familiar. He was taken to hospital when he contracted the virus in April and spent six weeks ""fighting for every breath"". Now able to return to work, he would usually take the train to Cardiff but has stopped because it is ""not safe"". ""Last Friday coming back from Cardiff, of 13 people in the [carriage] I was the only one with a face covering,"" he said. ""Unfortunately it's not being policed in any way. British Transport Police are not walking any carriages and three [train] guards have told me they've been ordered not to walk the carriages."" Mr Withers says his experience with the disease made the lack of compliance even more frustrating. ""It's making me angry simply because I know what it's like to have this disease. I know what it's like to lay there thinking, 'Am I going to make it?' ""Then you have these groups of people with an absolutely contemptuous attitude to it."" Transport for Wales said its staff have refused access to passengers not wearing masks, but enforcing fines was a matter for British Transport Police. However International Relations Minister Eluned Morgan said enforcement was the responsibility of ""both the transport and the police"". Transport for Wales said it had seen an overall 25% rise in passenger numbers since wearing masks became mandatory on 27 July and a ""general increase"" in compliance with wearing masks. ""If they're not [wearing masks] or haven't got any we have to turn them around,"" said safety director Leyton Powell. ""We recognise there are exceptions and not everybody, through certain health or medical reasons, can wear them, but can still travel."" British Transport Police said it would ""support rail staff in engaging with passengers, explaining the importance of preventing the spread of the virus and encouraging people to wear face coverings"". It said officers would issue fixed penalty notice fines for breaching the regulations ""as a very last resort"". What do passengers think? Most people waiting at Swansea bus station believed the majority of passengers were following the rules. ""I go in the morning to work and everyone is wearing a mask,"" said one commuter. ""And if you're not wearing one, the drivers will tell you."" Another said everyone was complying but added: ""It's a little but uncomfortable to wear and if you're wearing glasses you can get fogged up."" ""A lady wanted to get on this morning with no mask and the driver turned her away and wouldn't let her on,"" said Gloria Jones. ""I've also seen on the bus a gentleman coming on the bus and [the driver] told him to put it over his nose as well as his mouth."" First Cymru said its drivers have been told to avoid refusing travel and it had received only two reports of people refusing to wear masks. ""The reports are we've got a high standard of compliance,"" said head of operations Mark Jacobs. ""We try to avoid refusing travel [because] we don't want anyone vulnerable at the side of the road. ""But we also want our customers to heed the advice the government are giving out. Should somebody be persistent in not wishing to wear the mask then our drivers may refuse entry. Then there's a risk of conflict and obviously we also need to consider our drivers' safety."""
uk-politics-56484956,Has the pandemic pushed Wales and England further apart?,"The UK's nations have handled Covid differently, prompting some deep thinking about how future relationships should work.","By Alex ForsythPolitical correspondent, BBC News On a mid-March morning, by the bandstand in Bellevue Park, mums Carly Griffith and Becca Butler - babies in arms, standing at a Covid-safe distance - considered the past year. They live in Wrexham, in north Wales, not far from the border with England. From here, the different rules and restrictions applying in each country have become more apparent during the pandemic. ""We've been very aware that we're a border town,"" Carly said. ""And there are slight differences. But I don't think it was as obvious as it is now. ""We're all doing our own thing now, which I don't think everybody was aware that we had the power to do."" The four nations of the United Kingdom have managed the pandemic slightly differently, providing an example of devolution in action. For Becca, it is good thing that the Welsh government has moved at its own pace. ""I think they've handled it really well,"" she said. ""The numbers in England compared to Wales are two completely different things, so if the numbers are better in Wales then, yes, things should be lifted a bit sooner."" ""There have been good elements,"" Carly added. ""We need to make our own decisions, but I feel like we should work in collaboration with each other."" On the north Wales coast, couples and families were enjoying the spring sunshine in the town of Rhos-on-Sea. But, just off the promenade, the Peacock Lounge, a bar and restaurant, sat empty. Like all hospitality venues, it is unable to open. Owner Phillip Ashe has been frustrated at the different restrictions in England and Wales, which he said had confused customers and affected his business. ""Cardiff is 185 miles away from us,"" he said. ""We're 30 minutes from Chester. All the tourists from Chester were coming here thinking the rules were the same, when they're not."" Phillip said the pandemic had made him question the need for a Welsh Parliament. ""It's been party politics ever since day one,"" he added. ""We should have had one person lead from the beginning. ""This devolved stuff just isn't working."" The debate around devolution stretches back decades, and it is far from settled. For some, the pandemic has brought questions about who is best placed to make decisions on their behalf to the fore. In the heart of the Rhymney Valley, 17-year-old Evan Powell believes the pandemic has shown the potential for Wales to make more of its own decisions, as an independent country. ""It has shown without Westminster interference we would be able to thrive,"" he said. Evan will be able to vote for the first time in May, when 16 and 17-year-olds can have their say in elections to the Welsh Parliament. ""The younger generation, through social media or alternative news, have reached their own conclusions,"" he said, ""and I think that has helped the support for independence rise massively."" While the idea of independence might have gained momentum, it is still a minority view. In Newport, Stuart Curtis lives in the shadow of the M4 - a key route connecting Wales and England. He believes there is already too much division between the nations of the UK. ""I'm happy for there to be a Welsh government to look out for the heritage parts of Wales,"" he said. ""I think that is a good thing. But it goes too far. We are part of the United Kingdom, and that's how it should be."" This virus has not been constrained by countries or limited by lines on a map, but for some it has been a reminder of the borders that exist in the UK as the different nations have moved at a different pace. The question is whether or not that comes with any political consequence."
business-55752541,Brexit parcel price shock: 'I had to pay £30 for a gift',"A couple of weeks ago Lili Piraki, a London-based journalist, was surprised by a text out of the blue from delivery firm DHL.","By Lucy HookerBusiness reporter, BBC News She was delighted to hear a friend had sent her a present: a pair of gold earrings from Greece. She was less impressed that she would have to pay nearly £30 in taxes to receive the gift. The extra charges are a result of new post-Brexit rules that came into force on 1 January. Despite the free trade deal agreed before Christmas, which promised to smooth the UK's exit from the EU, new taxes and charges now apply to almost everything that goes back and forth between the two, including gifts, second hand items, products bought on Amazon or eBay and from private sellers. After we reported recently on Londoner Ellie Huddleston's shock at being asked to pay £82 to receive a £200 coat, dozens of you got in touch asking why they were being charged extra. So we asked some experts to run through five readers' experiences to explain the new charges. 1. 'My model car cost £12 more' Londoner Sascha Grillo was trying to add to his model collection by ordering a new car from a seller in Germany, but when he typed into the website that he wanted delivery to the UK, the price leapt up from £50 to £62. ""I was shocked, because I thought that with the Brexit deal, this wouldn't happen,"" he said. ""I thought day-to-day commercial transactions would remain the same, but this is not the case."" He decided not to buy. Why was he charged more? The free trade deal means there are no quotas or tariffs on the goods traded between the EU and UK, but that doesn't mean there are no extra taxes or costs. Since 1 January the UK is no longer part of the EU VAT regime, so the UK government is applying VAT (sales tax) at 20% on goods from the EU, explains Gary Rycroft, a partner at Joseph A Jones & Co Solicitors. In Sascha's case the new tax was applied at the ""point of sale"", in other words when he clicked to order. That is how the system is supposed to work on all goods worth under £135, says Martyn James from the free complaints website Resolver. UK VAT accounts for £10 of the extra £12 that Sascha was asked to pay. Sellers may also be charging higher delivery fees to cover any extra paperwork or border delays they may face. 2. 'I was charged an extra £123 for two handbags from Paris' Karishma Neog, an IT professional based in Bristol, has a weakness for designer handbags. In the first week of January she ordered two, one for her and one as a present, from a retailer in Paris, spending £600 plus £25 for delivery. When they arrived she was charged an extra £123. ""I had no inkling it was going to be the case,"" she says. There was no mention of it on the seller's site. Why was she charged? As with Sascha's cars, the charge was probably for UK VAT. But because Karishma's handbags were worth more than £135 she wasn't charged when she clicked to buy. Instead, when you buy more expensive items the VAT is applied when the items reach you. Michelle Dale from accountants UHY Hacker Young says the other possibility is that Karishma was charged customs duties. If you're buying something that comes from the EU, the free trade deal means you won't pay any customs duties. But, while Karishma's bags came from a seller in Paris, they may not be made from French materials, they might not even be made in France. The devil is in the detail when it comes to these ""rules of origin"" says Gary Rycroft. But they only apply to items over £135 that come from outside the UK and EU. So if you're buying a pricier item, it is always worth asking if any additional customs charges will apply. 3. Gifts can come with a nasty surprise Lili Piraki isn't the only one who was charged to receive a present. Even if the gift was wrapped and posted by a friend or relative it can still incur extra fees. Some readers thought they'd avoided extra charges by posting before Christmas, but many deliveries ran late, and so - because they arrived after 1 January - came with an extra bill to pay. The first thing Lili knew about the earrings from her friend was a series of texts from DHL asking for £28.85. ""I received a message from DHL saying in order to receive my gift I had to pay the taxes. I didn't even know anyone had sent me anything."" She checked all the details to be sure it wasn't a scam, and then paid the charges. Why was she charged? Gifts worth less than £39 don't attract any extra charges, explains Michelle Dale. But gifts over that, like gold earrings, are eligible for VAT and (if it's over £135) customs duties. And it's always the recipient who receives the bill. 4. 'Second-hand pottery on eBay was more expensive' When former soldier Hamish Clarke was stationed in Germany in the 1970s he developed an interest in modern European pottery. He still adds to his collection, buying on marketplaces or direct from sellers in Germany and Belgium. He spied four pieces of pottery he liked on eBay and agreed a price of €160 [£142] with the seller. ""When I tried to pay for it, it was asking for €191 euros,"" he says. He wondered whether the charges might have been avoided if he had bought directly from the seller. Why was he charged? There's no way around the import VAT, says Michelle Dale, and it applies to second hand items as well as gifts, even if you've bought them from a private individual. EBay already has its system set up to charge the extra VAT upfront. Amazon says VAT will always be charged at point of sale on its site too. But the system won't be running smoothly yet everywhere, warns Martyn James. 5. 'I was asked to pay £78 more for my £150 UK boots in France' Jemima Brown ordered a £150 pair of boots from a UK company to be delivered to her home in Auvergne, France. ""A week later I received an email from La Poste telling me that when the parcel was delivered it would only be handed over if I paid the €88 [£78] import duty,"" she says. The documentation said it was €43 for VAT, €30 for customs tariffs, and €15 handling fees. She rang the company which said she could reject the delivery and receive a full refund. Why was she charged? Shoppers on the continent buying from UK firms face the same rules as UK shoppers do in reverse so Jemima would have had to pay VAT and customs charges, because the boots or the materials they were made from, originated from outside the EU. Michelle Dale thinks Jemima was lucky to be able to reject the delivery so easily. Some firms are changing their terms and conditions so that customers have to cover the extra charges, even when goods are returned. Gary Rycroft says if a retailer doesn't make it clear that you might face extra fees, you could argue that these were ""hidden costs"" that you shouldn't have to pay. But don't expect that to be an easy battle to win."

world-46918799,10 Year Challenge: How the world has changed in a decade,"If you've been pretty much anywhere on the internet in the last couple of weeks, you'll have no doubt come across #10YearChallenge on social media.","If not, the premise is simple - post a 2009 photo of yourself next to a recent one, to show how much you've changed. Millions have taken part, but some have criticised it for being - among other things - narcissistic, ageist and sometimes a bit sexist. But now people are using the hashtag to reflect on bigger changes. Such as... Climate change In this tweet, footballer Mesut Ozil compares what appears to be a large iceberg on the left, and a melted iceberg on the right. Although the meme isn't entirely accurate - the photo on the left, of the Getz Ice Shelf in Antarctica, was taken in November 2016 rather than in 2008 - there's no denying that shrinking ice sheets continue to be a major issue. According to Nasa, Antarctica is losing about 127 gigatonnes of ice mass every year, while Greenland loses 286 gigatonnes annually. This, they say, is largely down to rising global temperatures being absorbed by oceans. The planet's average surface temperature has risen by about 0.9C since the late 19th century - and about a third of that has happened in the last decade. Environmental activist groups are also using the hashtag to highlight this issue. This post from Greenpeace bends the challenge a bit, by comparing archival photos from 1928 with images taken by Swedish photographer Christian Aslund in 2002. And Martin Kobler, the German Ambassador to Pakistan, tweeted out an article about climate change in the Pakistani region of Balochistan. According to the latest Global Climate Risk Index, Pakistan has been the eighth most-affected by climate change over the last two decades. Plastic pollution The year 2018 was when the world really woke up to the reality of plastic pollution as well as climate change. Scientists calculate that about 10m tonnes of plastic waste end up in the oceans every year - and that some of that can take hundreds of years to biodegrade. So some campaigners are turning the #10YearChallenge on its head to show that, while we might have changed a lot in the last decade, the plastic we throw away remains almost exactly the same. Global conflicts On 17 December, 2010, a Tunisian street vendor called Mohamed Bouazizi refused to pay a bribe to local officials, so had his fruit and vegetable cart confiscated as a result. Faced with an unforgiving bureaucratic process, he set himself on fire. This act, less than 10 years ago, was the catalyst for what was later known as the Arab Spring - a wave of protests across the Middle East and North Africa that, in some cases, led to bloody civil wars and a refugee crisis that saw a record number of people forced from their homes. To reflect on this, then-and-now photos of conflicts in Syria, Libya and Iraq have been posted on Twitter - with thriving street scenes contrasted with stark images of crumbling buildings. People are also posting photos of Yemen, where a three-year civil war has led to the world's worst humanitarian crisis today. And some positive changes, too People are also sharing some of the things that appear to have improved over the last decade. According to statistics from the World Bank and the UN, extreme poverty is currently at its lowest overall level in recorded history, child mortality and youth illiteracy are both down, and global average life expectancy has increased. But, sadly, this doesn't show the whole picture. While extreme poverty is at its lowest level globally, it is still getting rapidly worse in Sub-Saharan Africa - where the average extreme poverty rate is now about 41%. And although youth literacy has increased overall, it's still lowest in less developed countries - and it affects young women more than men. According to the most recent data, 59% of all illiterate youth are girls. While environmental damage is still very much an issue, there's no doubting that awareness of it has increased, leading many people and countries to try and switch to sustainable sources of energy. The International Energy Agency says that renewables surged in 2016, thanks in no small part to a boom in solar panel installation in China."
uk-41582874,Campaigner for gender-neutral passports wins court challenge,A campaigner has been given the go-ahead to bring a High Court challenge against the government over gender-neutral passports.,"Christie Elan-Cane wants passports to have an ""X"" category, which could be used by those who consider themselves neither fully male or female. The campaigner has fought since 1995 for this right. At a hearing in London, Mr Justice Gilbert granted Christie Elan-Cane permission to bring a judicial review. A full hearing of the challenge to the government's policy will now be held in the spring. At the moment UK passport holders have to indicate whether they are male or female. Last month, Canada became the latest country to offer citizens gender-neutral travel documents. Australia, Denmark, Germany, Malta, New Zealand, Pakistan, India and Nepal already have a third category. 'A basic human right' Christie Elan-Cane said that despite the International Civil Aviation Organisation - the UN agency in charge of passports - recognising the ""X"" option, the UK government has ""persistently refused"" to go in the same direction. ""The UK government are saying non-gendered people are not human, or if they are, they are just not as important as everyone else. ""They have dug their heels in and are not budging, but I don't think that is acceptable and that is why I have persevered."" Granting the petition, Mr Justice Gilbert said ""I am satisfied this case passes the test for the grant of permission, and is arguable."" After the ruling, Christie Elan-Cane said: ""I am reasonably optimistic as it is a basic human right to have your identity, but I cannot speculate how the case will go."" The BBC contacted the Home Office for a statement, but a spokesman said: ""It would be inappropriate to comment on ongoing legal proceedings."""

world-asia-pacific-13263888,North Korea 'behind South Korean bank cyber hack',Prosecutors in South Korea say North Korean hackers were behind an attack that paralysed a leading bank last month.,"Banking operations at Nonghyup, a South Korean farm co-operative, were halted by the cyber intrusion, leaving customers unable to access their money. The Seoul prosecutors' office called it ""unprecedented cyber-terror deliberately planned"" by North Korea. It said the software used matched that used in earlier attacks by Pyongyang. Prosecutors said that a laptop used by a subcontractor ""became in September 2010 a zombie PC operated by the North, which... later remotely staged the attack through the laptop"". One of the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses used to break into Nonghyup's system was the same as one used in March for a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that originated in North Korea, they added. The software used in the incident was also similar to that employed in July 2009, when a number of South Korean government websites were attacked, the prosecutors said. The latest attack caused a three-day service outage at the bank - also called the National Agricultural Co-operative Federation - and caused the records of some credit card customers to be deleted. South Korean media outlets have in the past accused North Korea of running an internet warfare unit aimed at hacking into US and South Korean government and financial networks. The two Koreas technically remain at war following the 1950-53 Korean War, and tensions have been high in recent months in the wake of two deadly incidents. South Korea blames North Korea for sinking its Cheonan warship in March 2010, with the loss of 46 lives, although North Korea denies any role in the incident. Four South Koreans were also killed when North Korean troops shelled a border island in November 2010."
entertainment-arts-32826996,Danny Boyle opens Manchester arts centre Home,Director Danny Boyle has taken part in the opening ceremony for a new £25m arts centre in Manchester.,"By Ian YoungsArts reporter The Trainspotting director, who oversaw the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games, is a patron of Home. Boyle delivered a speech to open the venue, which includes two theatres, five cinema screens and an art gallery. He praised the city council for having ""the courage to put their money where their mouth is about the importance of culture economically and socially"". Home is a replacement for the city's Cornerhouse cinema and gallery and Library theatre company. Its opening comes as plans are drawn up for another new venue, the 5,000-capacity Factory, which will cost £78m and is part of the government's plans to build a ""northern powerhouse"" to compare with London. Boyle said cultural venues could stimulate economic growth, but that Manchester should not be seen as a competitor to the capital. ""You've got to stop thinking about rivalling London,"" he said. ""That's one of the things I feel very strongly. ""People were saying to me [Home] is like the Barbican. It's not like the Barbican at all. It's much better than the Barbican. ""If you look at some European countries, they invest equally in multiple cities. There's lots of talk about the country splitting apart. The way you make the country cohesive is you have these cities which are huge beacons for the whole country, and it means we can all share in our country equally."" Home's first theatre production is The Funfair, award-winning playwright Simon Stephens's new version of 1932 Hungarian play Kasimir and Karoline, which is set in modern-day Manchester. Stephens, who also adapted The Curious Incident for the National Theatre, compared the current ""optimism and energy"" in Manchester's theatres with the city's music scene in the 1980s. ""It comes at a time when Manchester's theatre is increasingly confident,"" he said. ""I think it's remarkable, and I think Home will crystallise that. ""There's a whole generation of writers, actors and directors who can't afford to live in London any more because it's becoming prohibitively expensive. ""They're moving to Birmingham, they're moving to Cardiff, and in their handfuls they're moving to Manchester. I think this has the potential to be the most exciting theatre city in the UK."" However Ben Walmsley, a lecturer in audience engagement at the University of Leeds, queried why so much money was being spent in Manchester. ""There are people looking over the Pennines and wondering why all this investment's going into Manchester and if it needs to be more equally spread perhaps across the north of England and different communities,"" he said. ""Home is wonderful but I would severely question whether the city needs another 5,000 capacity venue which may just add further competition. ""There's a bigger question about what gets funded. Is it venues and buildings that some of them risk becoming white elephants?"""
business-34585219,What does the nuclear deal with China mean?,David Cameron and President Xi Jingping have signed a deal agreeing to Chinese investment in a new nuclear power station in Somerset.,"By Howard MustoeBusiness reporter It will be largest inward investment ever in the UK. France's EDF and CGN, a Chinese nuclear consortium, will build the plant, and possibly two more. Where will the power stations be built? The first will be built at Hinkley Point on the Somerset coast, and is expected to open by 2025 at a cost of about £25bn including financing. EDF says the cost in today's money will be £18bn. China will cover about a third of the cost. EDF said it might sell another 15% stake in the project, but would maintain a majority holding. This will be the third power station at the site. Hinkley Point A was shut down in 2000, while Hinkley Point B is still in use. The government insists that 25,000 jobs will be created by the new power station - Hinkley Point C - and enough energy to power six million homes. Two other stations, at Sizewell in Suffolk, and Bradwell in Essex, are due to follow. The plant at Bradwell is due to be Chinese-designed, which will provide China with its first Western showcase for its nuclear technology. Is it good news? The UK government has been criticised for guaranteeing the price that will be paid for any electricity the new Hinkley Point reactor produces. That could mean, critics such as Greenpeace say, higher energy bills for consumers. Security concerns have also been raised about allowing China a central role in Britain's nuclear future. Is it good value? Not everyone thinks so. The Solar Trade Association thinks solar power could provide the same amount of electricity for half the subsidy cost. Policy chief Mike Landy said: ""The government needs to explain why it is drastically cutting support for solar energy whilst offering double the subsidy to Hinkley Point C. ""It also needs to explain why it is championing overseas state-backed utilities over British solar companies which given stable support would have considerable growth prospects."" What is this subsidy and why is it needed? This is the so-called strike price. The previous government said it would not provide any public subsidies to the nuclear industry. It would not actually be illegal to do so, but the government had to get permission from the European Union, which it acquired for the strike price. As part of this deal, today's government said it is not continuing the ""no public subsidy policy"" of the previous administration. Insiders insist this apparent policy reversal is merely a ""clarification"" that the builders will get some guarantees, and does not open the door for more public money to be used. How does the price work in practice? In essence, the government has guaranteed EDF a price of £92.50 per megawatt hour (Mwh), or £89.50 if EDF develops another new reactor in Sizewell, Suffolk. This simply reflects the fact that EDF's costs will be lower per reactor if it builds two of them. If the market price of electricity falls below this level, the government has in effect said it will make sure EDF receives the difference between the two prices. The wholesale price of electricity at the moment is about £45/Mwh. If the wholesale price remains at this level, then EDF will receive an additional £47.50/Mwh. In practice, this money will not come from taxpayers (that would count as a subsidy), but from consumers of electricity. The strike price works the other way as well - EDF has to refund the difference if the price of electricity is above £92.50/Mwh. For example, if the wholesale price is £110/Mwh, then it has to refund £18.50/Mwh. Again, this money goes back to bill payers, not to the government. But why the need for any guaranteed price? Nuclear reactors cost a lot of money, and EDF wants to build two of them. The final bill for just Hinkley is estimated at £24.5bn including financing costs. Even for a massive company like EDF, this is a huge investment, which makes it inherently risky. For example, if the price of electricity falls, or becomes more volatile, the company could lose a lot of money. And because the plant would take 10 years to build, there is simply too much uncertainty to commit to such a huge investment without such comfort, investors would argue. For this reason, EDF needs an added incentive to build the reactors. Knowing it will receive a guaranteed price for the electricity generated at Hinkley provides some kind of certainty that the investment will be worthwhile - in other words, profitable. For its part, the government has been unable to play different energy companies off against each other, as German power giants RWE and E.On decided long ago against building new plants in the UK. It has, therefore, been forced to negotiate with EDF. But this doesn't mean EDF holds all the cards - the company is desperate to get Hinkley Point C started so it can serve as a blueprint for similar power stations across the world. So what does it mean for bills? Until we know the price of electricity on the open market when Hinkley Point C starts generating power, we simply won't know if it is a good or bad deal. If the electricity price is below the strike price, then bills will probably be higher than they would otherwise be. Conversely, if it is above the strike price, then bills would be lower. It will also depend on the energy mix at the time. In other words, how much of your electricity is generated by nuclear power. At the moment, almost 20% of the UK's power is generated by nuclear reactors, but this is likely to fall in the short term as the UK's current nuclear capacity is decommissioned. Better-insulated homes and more-efficient gadgets, could also lower usage in the future. This is all very well, but why are we building new nuclear power plants? Precisely because there will be a shortfall in electricity generation as a result of existing nuclear - and coal and gas - power stations shutting down. The question then is how to make up this shortfall. The government is committed to renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, but to get enough generating capacity from these sources will take too long, it says, so another solution is needed. In theory, it could simply increase power generation from traditional fossil fuels such as coal and gas, but stringent, legally-binding carbon dioxide emissions targets mean this is not possible. There is some room for an increase in gas-generated power, but as we import most of this gas, the government has concerns about energy security - it wants us to generate our own power, not rely on others for it. So, in the government's eyes, that leaves nuclear. And it wants EDF to lead by example, paving the way for other power companies to invest in new reactors in the UK, because two new reactors will not be enough."

uk-england-cambridgeshire-38601247,Bourn Airfield near-miss: Pilot's 'swift actions' avoided crash,"The swift actions of a light aircraft pilot avoided a ""catastrophic event"" over the skies of Cambridgeshire, an air report has concluded.","The pilot of a two-engine Islander was forced into a steep dive in July 2016 after spotting another plane coming towards him from the left. It got within 100m (328ft). It happened near Bourn Airfield, about 10 miles west of Cambridge. An Airprox report said the pilot of the unknown aircraft could not be traced. According to the air accident detail, the Islander pilot had to shut off power levers and put the aircraft into a steep descent in order to avoid a collision. It said he believed the second aircraft was a bi-plane, referred to as ""pop-up traffic"". Risk of a ""catastrophic event"" was high, and the aircraft descended 600ft before straightening up, the report said. The pilot was not injured. 'Good lookout' The incident, known in aviation terms as an airprox, was reported to RAF Lakenheath in Suffolk. The report was compiled by the UK Airprox Board, which assesses and investigates all incidents involving civil and military aircraft in UK airspace. ""If it were not for the prompt and deliberate actions of the handling pilot this would almost certainly have been a catastrophic event as the civilian aircraft was not seen to have manoeuvred until they were clear,"" the report said. The board determined that the second aircraft had ""probably not seen the Islander"" and that coupled with the late sighting by the Islander pilot were considered to have been the key factors in this airprox. ""This is a good example of the necessity of good lookout whilst operating within busy airspace, even if you are being provided with a suitable ATS (air traffic service),"" it said."
health-45704322,Nobel prize for medicine goes to cancer therapy,Two scientists who discovered how to fight cancer using the body's immune system have won the 2018 Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine.,"By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online The work, by Professor James P Allison from the US and Professor Tasuku Honjo from Japan, has led to treatments for advanced, deadly skin cancer. Immune checkpoint therapy has revolutionised cancer treatment, said the prize-giving Swedish Academy. Experts say it has proved to be ""strikingly effective"". Prof Allison, of the University of Texas, and Prof Honjo, of Kyoto University, will share the Nobel prize sum of nine million Swedish kronor - about $1.01 million or 870,000 euros. Accepting the prize, Tasuku Honjo told reporters: ""I want to continue my research ... so that this immune therapy will save more cancer patients than ever."" Prof Allison said: ""It's a great, emotional privilege to meet cancer patients who've been successfully treated with immune checkpoint blockade. They are living proof of the power of basic science, of following our urge to learn and to understand how things work."" Treating the untreatable Our immune system protects us from disease, but it has built-in safeguards to stop it from attacking our own tissue. Some cancers can take advantage of those ""brakes"" and dodge the attack too. Allison and Honjo, now both in their 70s, discovered a way to unleash our immune cells to attack tumours by turning off proteins that put the brakes on. And that led to the development of new drugs which now offer hope to patients with advanced and previously untreatable cancer. Immune checkpoint therapy is being used by the NHS to treat people with the most serious form of skin cancer, melanoma. It doesn't work for everyone, but for some patients it appears to have worked incredibly well, getting rid of the tumour entirely, even after it had started to spread around the body. Such remarkable results had never been seen before for patients like these. Doctors have also been using the treatment to help some people with advanced lung cancer. Prof Charles Swanton, from Cancer Research UK, congratulated the prize winners, saying: ""Thanks to this groundbreaking work, our own immune system's innate power against cancer has been realised and harnessed into treatments that continue to save the lives of patients. For cancers such as advanced melanoma, lung, and kidney, these immune-boosting drugs have transformed the outlook for many patients who had run out of options. ""The booming field of immunotherapy that these discoveries have precipitated is still relatively in its infancy, so it's exciting to consider how this research will progress in the future and what new opportunities will arise."" Medicine is the first of the Nobel Prizes awarded each year. The literature prize will not be handed out this year, after the awarding body was affected by a sexual misconduct scandal. Previous winners 2017- Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young for unravelling how bodies keep a circadian rhythm or body clock 2016 - Yoshinori Ohsumi for discovering how cells remain healthy by recycling waste. 2015 - William C Campbell, Satoshi Ōmura and Youyou Tu for anti-parasite drug discoveries. 2014 - John O'Keefe, May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser for discovering the brain's navigating system. 2013 - James Rothman, Randy Schekman, and Thomas Sudhof for their discovery of how cells precisely transport material. 2012 - Two pioneers of stem cell research - John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka - were awarded the Nobel after changing adult cells into stem cells. 2011 - Bruce Beutler, Jules Hoffmann and Ralph Steinman shared the prize after revolutionising the understanding of how the body fights infection. 2010 - Robert Edwards for devising the fertility treatment IVF which led to the first ""test tube baby"" in July 1978. 2009 - Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider and Jack Szostak for finding the telomeres at the ends of chromosomes."

Professor Richard Kennedy will lead the research initiative which tailors specific treatment to each cancer patient. Invest Northern Ireland and The McClay Foundation will give £1.5m of support. The rest will come from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). Professor Kennedy said the project was an excellent example of how business and academia could work together in the fight against cancer. ""The research will involve using cutting-edge technology developed by Almac which will allow us to analyse large numbers of patient tumours collected by Queen's,"" he said. Future cures ""We will develop these tests to help clinicians to better understand prostate, ovarian and breast cancer and prescribe the appropriate treatments tailored to the specific patient. ""We hope this will then improve the chances of cure using chemotherapy and radiotherapy."" The information obtained from the project will be used to design new therapies that could improve response chances and future cures for these cancers. Enterprise Minister Arlene Foster said Almac's research projects have delivered economic benefits and advancements in cancer treatment worldwide. ""The company is globally respected for its commitment to innovation and this collaboration project will build upon a successful and long-standing research relationship between Almac and Queen's University, Belfast."" she said.

business-34090038,Ex-Sainsbury's boss Justin King slams National Living Wage,"The National Living Wage will ""destroy jobs"", former Sainsbury's chief executive Justin King has claimed.","By Michael RobinsonBBC News Introducing a nationwide rate is ""ludicrous"", Mr King told BBC series The New Workplace. The living wage will come into force in April 2016 and set a new minimum pay level of £7.20 an hour for workers aged 25 and over. A Department for Business spokeswoman said it would ensure ""work pays"" and reduce reliance on benefits. She added: ""The new National Living Wage is an essential part of moving to a higher wage, lower tax, lower welfare society."" 'Not justified' The rate will be 50p an hour higher than the National Minimum Wage fixed by the Low Pay Commission. By 2020, Mr King argued, the Living Wage could be ""10% or 15% higher"" than the minimum wage equivalent. ""The Low Pay Commission has done tremendous work on the minimum wage for many years,"" Mr King said. But the living wage ""is not economically justified"", he added. Employers will seek to make their workforces more productive and that will lead to fewer jobs, he argued. ""You can't talk about productivity without recognising that one of the consequences of productivity is less people producing the same output"", Mr King said. ""Companies will invest in more productivity and as a consequence there will be less jobs."" 'Real risk' His comments come in the same week that Sainsbury's announced that, from 30 August, its 137,000 shop-floor staff, including workers under 25, will see their standard rate of pay rise 4% to £7.36 an hour. Frances O'Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, told The New Workplace she was concerned employers may replace older staff because the National Living Wage only applies to workers aged 25 or over. ""The real risk here is we see employers who want to keep their labour costs low substituting in young, lower-paid workers for adult workers who they would have to pay more,"" she said. Earlier this week, McDonald's UK chief executive Paul Pomroy told the BBC that his company was ""working through"" what the impact of paying the living wage was going to be. You can hear the full interview on The New Workplace at 12.04BST on Saturday, 29 August."
uk-scotland-scotland-business-35115291,Scottish businesses welcome plans for business rates review,Scottish business groups have welcomed plans for a review of business rates north of the border.,"The move was announced by Finance Secretary John Swinney in his draft budget. The Scottish government said the review would help to ensure that Scotland's system of business rates ""minimises the barrier to investment"". However, some business groups expressed concern at proposals to increase rates paid by larger firms. Mr Swinney said he was planning a ""modest increase"" to the Large Business Supplement in order to maintain the Small Business Bonus Scheme, which offers rates reductions for small firms across Scotland. He also said he was asking Scotland's biggest businesses to pay more in order to support investment of £345m in research and innovation and £1bn of investment in higher education. 'Great opportunity' Scottish Retail Consortium director David Lonsdale said: ""We are delighted that the Scottish government has listened to the retail industry and the growing chorus from across business and commercial life in Scotland who have spoken up in favour of fundamental reform of business rates, and we very much welcome the promised review of business rates. ""The review heralds a great opportunity to recast business rates for the decades ahead and we look forward to working with the government to ensure the reformed system is modern, sustainable and competitive. ""Business rates are set to generate almost £2.8bn in tax revenues next year, up from £2.1bn just six years ago. ""A fundamentally reformed rates system and a substantially lower tax burden would increase retailers' confidence about investing in new and refurbished shop premises, create more jobs and help revive high streets."" He added: ""The hike in the large firms rates supplement is concerning, and it now appears that larger firms operating in Scotland will be paying more in business rates than firms operating in comparable premises down south. ""That would be a departure from the pledge to keep rates here at the very least in line with the rest of the UK, and undermines claims to have the most competitive rates regime in the UK."" 'Piecemeal promises' The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said that while the Scottish government had ""sensibly refrained from making changes to the Scottish Rate of Income Tax for the coming year, it is notable that businesses have once again become a target for tax rises in Scotland"". Chief executive Liz Cameron said: ""The Scottish Government's plans to raid Scottish businesses to provide a further £130m in business rates next year does not sit well with its stated aims of supporting growth, jobs and exports. ""The deputy first minister also promised a review of business rates in Scotland and we welcome this. ""Scottish Chambers of Commerce has been calling for a genuine and fundamental review of business rates since the last revaluation in 2010. ""Previous government promises to review this tax have been piecemeal and ineffective and we will hold them to account on this latest pledge."""
health-56072460,Covid: 'No evidence' schools spread lots of coronavirus,"Schools do not appear to play a big role in spreading coronavirus, say UK researchers who have studied teacher and pupil absences during the pandemic.","The University of Warwick team looked at sick days taken because of Covid during the autumn 2020 term in schools across England. Absences matched infection rates in the wider community, with no evidence schools were a major driver of cases. The prime minister is yet to announce plans for reopening schools. English schools will not return before 8 March, Boris Johnson has said. The Northern Ireland Executive is also yet to decide if some or all pupils can return on 8 March. But in Scotland and Wales the youngest primary-school pupils are due to return on 22 February. Face-to-face learning Since the beginning of January, when the current lockdown began, primary and secondary schools have offered remote learning for most pupils. Vulnerable pupils and children of key workers have been able to attend for face-to-face learning. The University of Warwick researchers say the decision on schools must be a political one, balancing the social and educational benefits of letting more children return to the classroom against the potential Covid harms. Children can catch and spread coronavirus but are unlikely to become very sick with it. Continuing uncertainty The study was unable to determine whether any infected staff or pupils had caught the virus in the school setting. Co-researcher Dr Mike Tildesley said: ""We are not saying there is no risk. ""It's an absence of evidence."" There was continuing uncertainty about the impact reopening schools might have on the pandemic. And a cautious approach was needed, he said. 'Political decision' In the study, Covid-related absences were lower in primary schools than secondary. And there was a significant rise in secondary schools in the South East and Greater London in December, which might be linked to the more transmissible variant of the virus identified in Kent. Dr Tildesley said: ""You could potentially think about doing early years first. ""But this is a political decision."" The Public Health Agency says school transmission ""does occur but tends to be small scale"". Prof Sarah Lewis, an epidemiology expert at the University of Bristol, said it appeared that cases in the community were spilling into schools rather than vice versa, based on the available data."

The three-year project will employ four part-time workers. It also involves working with a dozen schools to help pupils to create allotments to produce their own food. ""We are really excited about this project,"" said Emma Maxwell, horticultural manager for the social enterprise group. ""It comes at a time when food poverty is coming up and we can make people aware about how to grow their own food and improve food knowledge. ""We really need to raise awareness that local food is more sustainable,"" she said. 'Snapped up' A big function of Cwm Harry Land Trust is to collect and compost all the food waste from the Welshpool, Llanidloes, Berriew, Newtown area, turning it into compost. As well as growing its own produce, it also helps other growers to sell to the community. Now, its Get Growing Project has received the backing of the Big Lottery Fund. The idea came about after the trust opened a community garden to start producing its own vegetables and then set up micro allotments on-site for growers which were ""snapped up"". It was formerly waste ground and which has now been ""transformed"" with polytunnels and raised beds producing food sold in vegetable boxes to the community with the waste then collected and turned into compost. The trust said they have ideas as to where the new community growing sites may be set up but they would welcome suggestions if anyone is aware of locations which may be suitable. In September it was announced that Cwm Harry Land Trust helped Powys communities Presteigne and Norton reach the Welsh government zero waste target to recycle 70% of waste 14 years ahead of schedule, compared with 37% across the county. By 2025 the Welsh government expects the country to recycle 70% of its waste."
world-europe-53568021,Van Gogh: Postcard helps experts 'find location of final masterpiece',"A postcard has helped to find the probable spot where Vincent van Gogh painted what may have been his final masterpiece, art experts say.","The likely location for Tree Roots was found by Wouter van der Veen, the scientific director of the Institut Van Gogh. He recognised similarities between the painting and a postcard dating from 1900 to 1910. The postcard shows trees on a bank near the French village of Auvers-sur-Oise. The site is 150m (492ft) from the Auberge Ravoux, the inn in the village, where Van Gogh stayed for 70 days before taking his own life in 1890. ""The similarities were very clear to me,"" said Mr Van der Veen, who had the revelation at his home in Strasbourg, France, during lockdown. Mr Van der Veen presented his findings to Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum, whose researchers conducted a comparative study of the painting, postcard and the hillside. The experts, senior researchers at the museum Louis van Tilborgh and Teio Meedendorp, concluded that it was ""highly plausible"" that the correct location had been identified. ""In our opinion, the location identified by Van der Veen is highly likely to be the correct one and it is a remarkable discovery,"" Mr Meedendorp said. ""On closer observation, the overgrowth on the postcard shows very clear similarities to the shape of the roots on Van Gogh's painting. That this is his last artwork renders it all the more exceptional, and even dramatic."" Mr Van der Veen visited the site to verify his theory in May 2020, once coronavirus restrictions had been lifted in France. A ceremony was held in Auvers-sur-Oise, a few miles north of Paris, on Tuesday to mark the discovery of the apparent location. Emilie Gordenker, the general director of the Van Gogh Museum, and Willem van Gogh, the great-grandson of Vincent's brother Theo, were in attendance to unveil a commemorative plaque at the site. 'The final strokes on a dramatic day' There has long been debate over which of Van Gogh's paintings was his last. In a letter Theo van Gogh's brother-in-law, Andries Bonger, described how the artist ""had painted a forest scene, full of sun and life"" on ""the morning before his death"". That letter has been used to support the claim that Tree Roots was Van Gogh's final work of art. Based on his postcard theory, Mr Van der Veen believes Van Gogh may have been working on the painting just hours before his death. Mr Van der Veen said: ""The sunlight painted by Van Gogh indicates that the last brush strokes were painted towards the end of the afternoon, which provides more information about the course of this dramatic day ending in his suicide.""

uk-england-oxfordshire-16325727,Bodleian Libraries completes Swindon move,A vast store for Oxford University's renowned Bodleian Libraries has taken delivery of its seven millionth book.,"The £26m warehouse in Swindon, which covers 13 acres and has 153 miles of shelving, is now home to many of the libraries' lesser-used editions. Library bosses decided to build the store after describing the lack of space as ""desperate"". The project to relocate the books is now complete and has been hailed as ""an extraordinary success"". Librarian Sarah Thomas said: ""This has been an important year in the history of the Bodleian. ""We have tagged and moved all our books, relocated our staff, prepared the New Bodleian building for its redevelopment, opened new facilities for readers in the heart of Oxford and refreshed and developed our IT capabilities. ""Any one of these tasks would be a major undertaking for most libraries, but, thanks to a superb team of dedicated staff, we have accomplished them all simultaneously without any major interruption to our day-to-day services. ""With our new storage facility at Swindon and renewed spaces for study in place or under development in the heart of Oxford, our readers can look forward to significant enhancements to our services in 2012 and beyond.' Popular items The Bodleian Libraries are 40 libraries serving Oxford University, including the Bodleian Library founded in 1602. They are entitled to a copy of every book published in the UK and have been running out of space to store works for decades. It will be predominantly low-usage books and maps which will be stored at the site, 28 miles from Oxford. More popular items and special collections - including four original manuscripts of the 13th Century Magna Carta - will remain in Oxford. Students have been told that if they order a book from the new unit by 10am, it should be delivered to the Oxford reading room of their choice by 3pm."
uk-politics-36864903,Labour leadership: Female MPs urge Corbyn to tackle abuse,Over 40 female Labour MPs have written to party leader Jeremy Corbyn urging him to do more to tackle abuse of MPs.,"The letter highlighted an ""extremely worrying trend of escalating abuse and hostility"" towards MPs in recent weeks. Women were disproportionately affected by these ""disgusting and totally unacceptable"" incidents, it said. Leadership rival Owen Smith has accused Mr Corbyn of not doing enough to clamp down on ""intolerance and misogyny"". Mr Corbyn has condemned harassment. The MPs' letter said: ""Rape threats, death threats, smashed cars and bricks through windows are disgusting and totally unacceptable in any situation. ""This is acknowledged by all factions yet the simple words of condemnation offered in response are inadequate. We expect swift and tangible action against those who commit such acts. ""We understand that the leadership does not have total control over those who choose to threaten and abuse others but that does not mean that more cannot be done to safeguard our female colleagues."" It continues: ""We have also been alarmed to learn that our shadow chancellor and other members of the shadow cabinet have addressed rallies and events in which demonstrations outside MPs' offices and bullying at CLP meetings have been either actively encouraged or quietly condoned."" The letter asks Mr Corbyn to make three pledges including ""an unequivocal statement declaring his support for all MPs, particularly women, and clearly condemning campaigning outside MPs' offices, surgeries etc"". It finishes: ""Jeremy, this is being done in your name."" 'Permissive environment' Unite trade union leader Len McCluskey has, meanwhile, suggested in an interview with the Guardian, that the security services could be behind the abuse and intimidation of MPs on social media. Mr McCluskey claims MI5 could be using ""dark practices"" to ""stir up trouble"" for Mr Corbyn, arguing that spies had infiltrated trade unions in the past, and that the truth about it had been suppressed for 30 years, under the rule on keeping classified documents out of the public domain. Mr Smith distanced himself from the suggestion, saying at a campaign rally in Manchester: ""I'm not sure that's entirely right."" All Labour constituency parties have been suspended for the duration of the leadership campaign amid ongoing turmoil while several MPs who oppose Mr Corbyn have accused his supporters in the Momentum group of trying to intimidate them and their staff. Angela Eagle, who withdrew her own leadership bid earlier in the week, has suggested Mr Corbyn was ""stirring"" the trouble, telling the Daily Telegraph he had encouraged a ""permissive environment"" within the party and she now feared for her staff's safety. The former shadow business secretary says her constituency office was vandalised last week. She has said she is cancelling walk-in surgeries in her Wallasey constituency on police advice - although Merseyside Police said it had been her own decision to do so. Mr Smith said he agreed with Ms Eagle that Mr Corbyn had not taken nearly a firm enough line on evidence of intimidation, both on social media and elsewhere. ""I think Jeremy should take a little more responsibility for what is going on in the Labour Party,"" he told the BBC News Channel. ""After all, we didn't have this kind of abuse, intolerance, misogyny and anti-Semitism in the party before Jeremy Corbyn became leader."" He added: ""It is not good enough for Jeremy to say he has threats too. I have had threats too and I am telling him 'it has got to be stamped out and we have to have zero tolerance' of this in the Labour Party. ""The truth is many of the people who are heaping abuse on people are Jeremy's supporters. It is just a fact that it is Jeremy's side of the argument that is engaging in this great volume of abuse."" 'Swift and tangible' action Mr Corbyn said he had spoken out against ""any forms of abuse whatsoever in politics or public life"" and had immediately contacted Ms Eagle after he learnt of claims a brick had been thrown through the window of her constituency office, which is being investigated by police. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said both he and Mr Corbyn had been the target of abuse themselves and the Labour leader had ""moved heaven and earth"" to try to stamp it out. He called on Mr Smith to ""stop attacking Jeremy personally"". Conor McGinn, the MP for St Helens North, told Politics Home he had been subjected to a ""torrent of abuse"" by the Labour leader's supporters in recent weeks but his claims have been denied by the party leadership. And more than two thirds of Labour's women MPs have called on Mr Corbyn to take ""swift and tangible"" action against those engaging in threatening behaviour which they say has caused them and their staff ""severe distress"". The signatories - including former shadow ministers Heidi Alexander, Paula Sherriff and Kerry McCarthy - said campaigning outside MPs' homes and offices and bullying at constituency meetings should be condemned rather than ""quietly condoned"". Mr Corbyn said he had spoken out against ""any forms of abuse whatsoever in politics or public life"" and had immediately contacted Ms Eagle after he learnt of claims a brick had been thrown through the window of her constituency office, which are being investigated by police. The Labour leader, who launched his official re-election campaign on Thursday, said he had put in place a ""very clear"" code of conduct for how he and his supporters should behave during the two-month leadership contest - to be decided on 24 September. He said: ""I have made it clear that harassment and abusive language have absolutely no place in our political discourse. ""I receive plenty of abusive language and I do not respond to it any way because I don't want to demean myself or promote the person who is using that kind of abusive language. I think we should lower the temperature and increase the quality of our debate."" Mr Corbyn will seek to galvanise his own supporters at a series of UK-wide meetings on Saturday - with rallies in Salford, London, Bristol, Nottingham, Birmingham, Liverpool, Hull, Glasgow and Cambridge."
technology-26819483,Rural broadband maps criticised for lacking detail,The government and BT are under fresh attack for the way the rollout of the UK's rural broadband is being handled.,"By Leo KelionTechnology reporter A committee of MPs said that many of the maps released lacked sufficient detail about coverage and the speeds that would be provided. It also questioned the costs involved. It added that it had heard allegations that BT had been able to ""kill the competition"" by altering its own plans. Both the company and the government have defended their record. ""It is... frustrating that the committee continues to try and pick holes in the programme,"" said a spokesman for the firm. ""BT is delivering value for money and the National Audit Office acknowledged there are 'robust' processes in place to ensure that. As for maps, most councils have published coverage maps with our support. More detailed data will be released by them in due course once surveys have been completed and we know for sure that we are going to an area."" Communications minister Ed Vaizey highlighted that the regulator Ofcom had recently ranked the UK's provision of broadband ahead of other countries. ""Britain has the best superfast broadband of all five leading European economies,"" he said. ""The government's nationwide broadband rollout is ahead of schedule; multiple robust safeguards are already in place to ensure value for money, and thousands of homes and businesses up and down the country are already getting the benefits."" 'Monopoly position' By 2015, the government will have given a total of £490m in grants to English local authorities and administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to subsidise the infrastructure needed to improve rural broadband. Its goal is that by 2015 all UK premises can experience at least two megabit per second downloads and that 90% of premises can access ""superfast"" downloads of at least 20Mbps. The councils and administrations have to match the cash with their own funds and pick a contractor. The firm then adds cash of its own, which it can later recoup through customer fees. Nine firms initially showed interest, but the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (Pac) warned last year that taxpayers faced being ""ripped off"" after BT won the first 26 bids put out to tender. Since then BT has secured all of the 18 further contracts offered. The committee said that placed the company in a ""monopoly position"" meaning officials could never be sure if they had got value for money. Pac also raised concern that the maps published by local bodies showing where broadband would be offered often lacked detail. It said this made it hard for other organisations to work out where they could pursue their own independent schemes to fill gaps in BT's coverage or offer faster speeds. Pac said the government should therefore work ""urgently"" alongside local bodies to make it possible for homes and businesses to carry out searches based on their full postcodes that revealed whether they were covered and the intended speed of service. The committee noted it had heard allegations that BT had taken advantage of the ""inadequate"" information it had originally provided; both to expand into areas that rivals had subsequently shown interest in, and to refuse to boost speeds to at least one village that it declared too expensive to cover after winning a contract. The Independent Networks Co-operative Association (Inca) - which represents smaller internet providers - has highlighted cases in Wiltshire and Lancashire where it said community schemes had been cancelled or put at risk by BT ""overbuilding"" its projects. ""Government and local authorities must make sure that alternative schemes, pulling in additional private sector and community funding, are supported not stymied,"" Inca's chief executive Malcolm Corbett told the BBC. ""Allowing BT to use state funding to undermine competitors is not in the interests of rural communities, nor the UK as a whole."" Subject to change But a spokesman for BT explained any changes in its plans as being the result of the surveys it carried out after being awarded the contracts. ""The fibre broadband programme is constantly evolving, and there is no definitive rollout plan until we complete detailed survey work in each locality,"" said a spokesman. ""This means that plans will undoubtedly change. For example in Cornwall, we originally said we'd be able to connect 85% of the county, but we now expect to get to around 95-97%. ""That could happen in other areas too, but we can also encounter obstacles in certain locations, like blocked ducts or lack of available power, which makes the cost of deploying fibre prohibitive."" A further £500m of taxpayers' funds has been earmarked to enhance coverage after 2015. Before that happens Pac has urged the government to analyse and publish details of this round's deployment costs to help local authorities be better informed . The committee also suggested work be done to address a ""lack of competitive tension"" in the tendering process."
uk-wales-47317831,Pembrokeshire council tax to go up by nearly 10%,"Council tax in Pembrokeshire will go up by nearly 10% in April, despite calls from some councillors for more cuts.","The independent-run authority is looking to make savings across the board to plug a £20m budget shortfall. The 9.92% increase will add nearly £100 a year to a Band D council tax bill, taking it to £1,093 a year, plus police and community council charges. It is still likely to be the lowest council tax in Wales, as most other Welsh councils already charge more. The neighbouring counties of Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion currently charge £1,197 and £1,226 respectively. Pembrokeshire's £221m budget for 2019-20 was backed by a meeting of the full council in Haverfordwest earlier, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Bob Kilmister, the cabinet member responsible for finance, said work on a service prioritisation plan would start as soon as next week. He said projects totalling £600,000 would be spent on school improvements, but customer contact centres could be scrapped in favour of a different way of providing the services. Phil Kidney, an independent councillor for Manorbier, said this risked ""disenfranchising"" many residents. Former council leader Jamie Adams said the authority could make more savings through a review of its buildings, rather than ""simply asking the taxpayer for more money"". John Davies, another former leader, said the current administration had increased taxes more in two years than the previous leadership did in a decade. Services such as tourism marketing and public toilet provision have also come under the spotlight in recent months, as council leaders have consulted the public on budget options. Welsh Government cash funding for Pembrokeshire - covering about three-quarters of council spending - is going up by 0.2%, well below the rate of inflation. However, the Welsh Government said it had offered councils ""the best settlement possible in this ninth year of austerity"". Yesterday, councillors in neighbouring Carmarthenshire agreed a budget with a council tax increase of 4.89%, adding £58 to the annual bill for a Band D property."
business-53635210,Coronavirus holiday claims push Hiscox into a loss,Insurance company Hiscox said it has set aside $232m (£177m) to cover coronavirus-related claims including cancelled holidays and major sporting events.,"The provisions helped pushed the firm into a loss for the first half of 2020, compared to a profit last year. Hiscox boss Bronek Masojada said it had been a ""testing six months"". ""Some of these [travel] companies have gone bust and we are picking up the tab,"" he said. The firm is said to be part of a group of insurers which underwrote the cancellation of Wimbledon this year, although such losses are spread among a number of companies. Other payouts will have come from cancelled weddings and postponed shooting for films and TV shows. Hiscox is among eight insurers going to court to decide whether their policies should pay out to firms hit by the coronavirus. The Financial Conduct Authority watchdog has said the test case, which started in July, will provide clarity to policy holders and that other insurers could be affected. It follows complaints from firms, some of whom say they could go under, after insurers refused to cover their losses. An outcome is expected in mid-September, Hiscox said. 'Shock and amaze' Hiscox's reported a $138.9m pre-tax loss for the six months to June, compared to a $168m in the same period last year. ""Having been in the business of risk for 47 years, one might expect to become somewhat immune to surprises, but some events have the ability to shock and amaze. Covid-19 has proven to be thus,"" said chairman Robert Childs. Gross written premiums also fell, down 4.4% to $2.24bn. Hiscox's share price fell 5% to 742p on Monday. Insurance market Lloyd's of London, of which Hiscox is a member, said in May that it expected coronavirus-related claims to cost it between $3bn and $4.3bn. That would mean the biggest amount the market has paid out since the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US."
10287396,Island-wide voting options go before States of Guernsey,Guernsey could have island-wide voting by the next deputies election in 2012 if the latest plans are approved.,"Deputies will be asked to choose between three options for how it could work at their June meeting. The States Assembly and Constitution Committee came up with the choices after a public consultation. Under the current system the island is divided into seven electoral districts which each elects members of the island's government. The first option would see all 45 deputies elected via an island-wide vote every four years, meaning all voters pick from the same list of candidates. The second is similar but with the elections every two years and half the number of government seats being elected each time. The third option would see 10 parish deputies elected, as with the current system, and 35 other members via an island-wide vote. The States will also be asked whether people should be able to vote for as many candidates as they wish or be limited to a maximum of 10."

uk-56794047,Covid: More than 10m people fully vaccinated in UK,"More than 10 million people in the UK have received a second dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, according to the latest government figures.","It means more than 19% of UK adults are now fully vaccinated, while nearly 33 million people have had their first dose. Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the news as a ""remarkable milestone"". Also hailing the ""terrific milestone"", the health secretary urged people to get the jab ""as soon as possible"". ""Second doses are crucial to maximising the strength and duration of your protection from Covid-19,"" he added. Sir Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said: ""The success of the NHS vaccination programme is not a happy accident. It is down to careful planning coupled with the sheer hard work and determination of doctors, nurses and countless other staff ably assisted by volunteers and many others."" It comes as the UK recorded four deaths within 28 days of a positive test - the lowest daily figure since 7 September, although the number of deaths recorded on Mondays and over the weekend tend to be lower because of reporting delays. There were also 2,963 new cases, according to the latest government figures. Mr Hancock told the Commons the government was ""on track"" to offer a first dose to all adults in the UK by the end of July and uptake had been ""astonishingly high"", at 94% for over-50s. However, he said the vaccination rate for care home staff was currently below 80% in more than half of all local authority areas. As a result, he said, the government had launched a consultation into whether care home providers for older adults should only deploy workers who have received their Covid jab, unless they have a medical exemption. People aged 45 and over are now being offered the vaccine in England and Scotland. In some areas of Wales 40-49 year-olds are being invited, while in Northern Ireland vaccine appointments are now being made available to a limited number of 35-39 year olds. The rollout will continue to prioritise groups by age, according to advice from the Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The 10 million mark for second doses is a great milestone. But the rapid acceleration in second doses has come at a cost to first doses - and this spells trouble for the government's ambition to offer every adult in the UK a jab by the end of July. Currently the UK is doing just over 100,000 first doses a day on average, that is down from 500,000 a month ago. There was always going to be some drop-off. But on that trajectory just over half of under-50s will get a first dose by the end of July. Take-up is predicted to be lower in the younger age groups than it has been in the older ones so that shortfall may not be as bad as it first looks. What is more, there is the hope vaccine supplies will increase. More doses of Moderna may become available, while there is hope the Novavax jab, which is being made in the UK, could come into play in May. Nonetheless, it is another reminder that the vaccine programme still has many hurdles to cross. It comes after the government said all over-50s and those in high-risk groups in the UK had been offered a first dose. Earlier this month the UK began to roll out the Moderna vaccine, alongside the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech jabs. All under-30s in the UK will be offered an alternative to the AstraZeneca jab due to evidence linking it to rare blood clots. Meanwhile, Mr Hancock announced that India would be added to the travel red list from 04:00 BST on Friday. It means anybody who is not a UK or Irish resident or British citizen cannot enter the UK if they have been in India in the last 10 days and any other arrivals will need to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. Earlier, the prime minister cancelled a trip to India, which had been due to take place on 26 April, amid rising cases there. Health officials in the UK are investigating whether a variant first found in India spreads more easily or is resistant to treatments or vaccines. Mr Hancock said there had now been 103 cases of this variant detected in the UK, with the vast majority linked to international travel. He said there had also been 557 cases of the variant first found in South Africa detected in the UK since December. The health secretary said the government was ""ramping up"" plans for a booster shot to ensure vaccines stayed ""ahead of the virus"". ""We will be working with our current vaccine suppliers and new suppliers, like the CureVac partnership, to work out which vaccines will be effective as a booster shot and to design new vaccines specifically targeted at the variants of concern,"" he added."

It is thought Lossiemouth could lose its Tornado fleet to RAF Marham. Michael Moore, speaking in the Commons, promised help would be provided to the local area but insisted no final decision had been made. Later, during Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron denied accusations of concentrating defence spending in the south of England. Meanwhile, First Minister Alex Salmond has written to Defence Secretary Liam Fox setting out concerns about the RAF bases in Moray. Mr Salmond said: ""I fully appreciate that tough decisions must be made in times of financial constraints. ""However these sorts of decisions must also be fair, balanced and responsive to wider long-term social and economic impacts, particularly where these cannot be absorbed easily within local communities."" It is feared the base's Tornado fleet could be transferred to RAF Marham in Norfolk, where engineering work for the aircraft is already based. It has been suggested RAF Kinloss could be retained as a barracks for soldiers returning from Germany. Defence sources have already said the troops would not arrive until about 2015 at the earliest. Moray's two RAF bases contribute more than £150m to the local economy annually and support about 5,700 jobs, a report said earlier this year."

world-australia-50055277,African swine fever: Australia expels Vietnamese woman over pork haul,Australian authorities have expelled a Vietnamese woman after officials found 10kg of undeclared food in her luggage.,"The 45-year-old arrived at Sydney airport on Saturday with raw pork, quail, pate, squid and other food items, officials said. It is the first time Australia has cancelled a visa over food under strict new bio-security laws aimed at keeping African swine fever out of the country. The contagious disease has decimated pig numbers across Asia and Europe. ""In the midst of what is potentially the biggest animal disease event the world has seen, it beggars belief that someone would deliberately attempt to bring pork meat past our border,"" Agriculture Minister Bridget McKenzie said in a statement. Under an amendment to Australia's Migration Act passed in April, visitor visas can be shortened or cancelled for bio-security contraventions. On-the-spot fines can also be given to offenders, but authorities said that - given the scale of her offence - the unnamed woman was sent back to Vietnam instead and is banned from visiting Australia for three years. Pork is big business in Australia - official figures estimate that the country's pork industry is worth more than five billion Australian dollars ($3.4bn; £2.6bn). Australian bio-security agencies have stepped up screening efforts at airports and mail distributors in an effort to contain African swine fever. Concerns were raised after the disease was detected last month in East Timor, one of Australia's closest neighbours. Ms McKenzie said that 27 tonnes of pork products have been seized at Australia's borders since February. The minister noted a ""concerning"" increase in the number of these products contaminated with ASF, saying contamination rates jumped from 15% in February to 48% in September. ""That is why, if you are travelling from an African swine flu affected country, we are watching you,"" said Ms McKenzie. Countries across Asia have been struggling to contain the spread of ASF, an incurable condition that is not dangerous to humans but is fatal to pigs. The disease has a mortality rate of up to 100%, according to the UN. It emerged in East Africa in the early 1990s, moved through sub-Saharan Africa, and has also been recorded in Europe. China - which has half the world's pigs, and where pork is often a staple food - confirmed an outbreak last August. Since then, more than one million pigs have been culled in China, and over five million in Vietnam. In South Korea hundreds of soldiers and civilian hunters have been deployed along the country's border with North Korea to kill wild boars and feral pigs to stop the spread of the disease."
uk-30287880,"Murders linked to probation changes, says Napo","Changes to the way offenders are supervised in England and Wales may have contributed to two murders, says the probation officers' union.","The union said that in one case a man who killed his partner then himself had been under the supervision of an ""overworked"" trainee officer. It urged the government to halt the changes, which involve contracting out the monitoring of some offenders. The Ministry of Justice said it would ""robustly"" contest the allegations. Appearing before the justice select committee on Tuesday, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling questioned the claims made by the National Association of Probation Officers (Napo). He said: ""The trade union has, on occasion, put forward information and have not given full context or accuracy of the situation. ""However it is really important to be clear that the number of serious further offences since the reforms began in June is lower than it was."" Safety 'risk' As part of the changes, offender management was split between different agencies six months ago. By early next year, private firms and voluntary groups will be responsible for the supervision of 200,000 low and medium risk offenders. These organisations are called ""Community Rehabilitation Companies"" - or CRCs - and the contracts are worth about £450m a year over seven years. But Napo argues that move as well as staff shortages are putting public safety at risk. It is also concerned because staff working for the CRCs do not have full access to offenders' records and are therefore unable to accurately assess the risk they pose. This is because of the data protection laws and protocols around private companies being allowed to look at the databases of the National Probation Service (NPS). In an 18-page letter to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, the union highlights a recent case of one offender ""with a history of domestic violence"" who went on to murder his partner before taking his own life. It claims the trainee allocated to undertake home visits to the man was ""too overworked"" to visit every four months as required. Another probation officer was ""unable to spend sufficient time working with an offender"", the letter alleges, because of an ""excessive caseload"". ""Left without suitable supervision, the offender committed a murder while under supervision of the CRC,"" it added. 'Immature' The union highlighted a case in which a probation officer was sexually assaulted on a visit, and said that ""defects in the ICT system"" prevented her seeing a ""risk flag that the offender should not be seen alone by female officers"". In his letter, Napo general secretary Ian Lawrence said the union did not believe the MoJ had enough evidence ""to show that it is safe to proceed"" with the transfer of shares in the CRCs to the winning bidders. When talking specifically about Mr Grayling he said: ""Here's a minister that not only sits on information that's vital to the public interest, he refuses to engage directly with Napo on the basis that he says our campaign is immature. ""I don't think it's immature when we are highlighting key issues of public safety, serious further offences, a risk to our staff, and a risk to communities at large."" But a Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said the department had tested its changes to the system at ""every stage"". ""We will be robustly defending the allegations made by Napo and expect new providers to be in place and delivering services by early 2015,"" the spokeswoman added. ""Reoffending rates have been too high for too long, and we must act now to turn the tide on this unacceptable problem. ""It would be inappropriate to comment further while legal proceedings are ongoing."""

'Slur' DUP representative William McCrea, who is the MP for South Antrim, said he appreciated that Mr Biden said it was a joke, but added he did not view the comments as humorous. ""When Northern Ireland is making such an effort to make St Patrick's Day an inclusive celebration, Joe Biden's comments were disgraceful and careless,"" Mr McCrea said. ""Whether they were intended as a joke or not, the comments are a slur on those who would be known as 'orange' - i.e. Protestants.

business-21762247,"France to miss deficit target, President Hollande says",President Francois Hollande has admitted France will miss its target on lowering the budget deficit this year.,"France's deficit will ""without a doubt"" be 3.7% of its output this year, he said, above the 3% he promised to cut it to during the election last year. The 3% deficit target is also one set by the European Union - but most of the major euro nations are in breach. The news comes as France's economic progress was criticised by a European Central Bank board member. ""The reform course in France seems to have floundered,"" Germany's Jens Weidmann said. ""The crisis that we are facing is a crisis of confidence, and this confidence cannot be gained if we postpone the tackling of the root causes of the crisis,"" Mr Weidmann said, referring to France, Italy and Cyprus as countries that still face tough financial situations. Greece, Ireland and Portugal have been effectively shut out of borrowing long term on international financial markets, which forced them to seek help from European partners and the International Monetary Fund. They all adopted austerity policies to cut public spending, but France has bucked the trend, raising taxes instead to protect its social model. During the election last year, Mr Hollande vowed to bring the deficit to 3% from its current 4.5% and had insisted this was possible until now admitting defeat. But he defended his record, saying that the deficit has come down from more than 5% in 2011. ""In two years, we have performed a structural recovery,"" the president said on Tuesday, that ""is as unprecedented as it is significant"". ""Addressing our accounts is a financial obligation... but it is also an obligation of sovereignty because France must never be in difficulty in the markets."" The ECB's other German board member, Joerg Asmussen, last month urged France to take ""concrete and measurable"" steps to bring down its budget deficit. The number of jobless in France has now risen past 3 million."
uk-northern-ireland-50063444,Brexit: DUP says 'gaps remain' after Johnson meeting,The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has said further work is required before it will back any fresh Brexit agreement.,"Members of the party met Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the second night in a row amid speculation a deal is close. Earlier, party leader Arlene Foster said the DUP would ""stick with our principles"" that NI ""must remain"" in the United Kingdom's customs union. It comes after the Guardian said the UK has made further concessions over the issue of customs and the Irish border. Downing Street has played down reports of an imminent deal with the EU. In a statement following the 90-minute meeting, the DUP said: ""We respect the fact negotiations are ongoing therefore cannot give a detailed commentary but it would be fair to indicate gaps remain and further work is required."" The DUP has consistently opposed any new customs checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, while the EU and the British government have both said there cannot be a hard border within the island of Ireland. Asked earlier if the DUP had given any ground on customs checks, Mrs Foster told BBC News NI: ""We are in a negotiation. I think it is right to give the negotiators space and time to do all of this. ""Everybody knows what our position is in relation to the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK. ""That is where we stand, we continue to stand there."" She added that the DUP had always said Northern Ireland must be ""integrally within the UK"" and dismissed some speculation around a Brexit deal as ""so far off of the mark you can't see the mark anymore"". On Tuesday, EU negotiator Michel Barnier said there was a ""narrow path"" to a Brexit deal this week but the two sides would have to agree the details by the end of the day. Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said talks were ""moving in the right direction"" but gaps between the sides remained. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 31 October. Mr Barnier said there was a ""narrow path"" to be trod between the EU's objective of protecting the single market and Boris Johnson's goal of keeping Northern Ireland in the UK's customs territory. The original Brexit deal struck between the EU and former Prime Minister Theresa May contained a clause known as the backstop, which would have seen the whole of the UK staying in the customs union for an indefinite period. The DUP also opposed an earlier proposal from the EU that would have involved Northern Ireland alone remaining in the EU's customs union. Mrs Foster said there was ""no point reinventing that"" and called for flexibility from the EU."
uk-england-dorset-20962034,Landslip fears close Portland's Tout to Blacknor coast path,"A section of coastal path in Dorset has been temporarily closed owing to the threat of landslides, following recent heavy rainfall.","Dorset County Council said there was ""evidence of substantial landslide movement"" on the path between Tout and Blacknor on Portland. The authority also reported rock fall on slopes below the bridge north of Blacknor. The path will be diverted further inland from Friday. 'Extreme rainfall' The decision follows a number of landslips and mudslides in the county, including one in Lyme Regis in December which left a beach chalet dangling over the edge of a cliff. A spokesperson for the council's coastal rangers team said: ""Experience has shown that these landslides can be slow and progressive but quite clearly they could also collapse quickly and unexpectedly, especially after such extreme rainfall."" Charlotte Blackman, 22, from Heanor, Derbyshire died on 24 July after the 160ft (49m) high cliff above her collapsed onto Hive Beach near Burton Bradstock. Five people escaped unhurt after a landslide on 8 August between Charmouth and Golden Cap. The county council said the path between Tout and Blacknor would be closed for ""the next few months"", while monitoring and repairs are carried out. The coast path between Burton Freshwater and Hive Beach is also currently closed and being diverted inland."

Chekatt was shot dead by police after a manhunt lasting two days. IS said he was one of their ""soldiers"" after the 11 December attack but French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner cast doubt on this claim. The group's self-styled news agency Amaq said Chekatt had ""carried out the operation in response to calls for targeting citizens of coalition countries"" fighting its militants in Syria and Iraq. What else do we know about Chekatt? Chekatt was born in Strasbourg and was already known to the security services. He was on the ""fiche S"" watchlist of people who represent a potential threat to national security. He had 27 convictions for crimes including robbery spanning France, Germany and Switzerland, and had spent considerable time in prison as a result. Chekatt was killed in an exchange of fire with police in the Neudorf area and was later identified through his fingerprints. Officers found an old gun, still loaded, some ammunition and a knife on his body. Seven people were initially arrested in connection with the attack. Chekatt's parents and two of his brothers were among those detained, but have since been freed. Who were the victims? Barto Pedro Orent-Niedzielski died at about 18:00 local time last Sunday (17:00 GMT). He had spent five days in a coma and never recovered. His family had kept him on life support so that those close to him could come to say goodbye at the Hautepierre hospital in the city. Kamal Naghchband was a garage mechanic originally from Afghanistan. The father of three had been visiting the market with his family and was shot in the head. Anupong Suebsamarn, 45, was a Thai national on holiday with his wife. Antonio Megalizzi, a 29-year-old Italian journalist, was critically injured in the attack and his death was announced three days later. A retired bank worker aged 61, from Strasbourg, also died. About 10 people remain injured, several seriously."

She said she wanted to thank her constituents, particularly NHS and other key workers, during the lockdown and praised the work of organisations such as the Hyndburn and Ribble Valley domestic violence team. Mr Evans confirmed it was the first time a maiden speech had been given by somebody not physically in the chamber. Ms Britcliffe said: ""I would have liked to have done it among my friends and colleagues but realise that it is so important that everyone gets behind the social distancing measures the government has put in.""

Mr O'Leary has called for a ""harsher line on sentencing"" for people who assault emergency workers.

""Being assaulted in this way is an absolutely despicable crime at the best of times. But, it certainly is in the current climate when everyone's worried sick about Covid-19,"" he said. 'Applaud custodial sentences' He said the force had been ""fairly lucky"" that judges and magistrates had been ""handing out custodial sentences"" to those charged with the ""Covid-19-related assaults"". ""While the sentences may never be enough for some, the fact that they are being issued custodial sentences should be applauded,"" he added.

uk-scotland-53930943,Coronavirus: Some schools warned to use hand gel 'sparingly',"Some schools have been urged to use hand sanitising gel ""more sparingly"", BBC Scotland has learned.","By Jamie McIvorBBC Scotland education correspondent Schools have put strict hygiene measures in place since they reopened a fortnight ago. BBC Scotland also spoke to one head teacher who claimed their school had to meet the cost of extra supplies from its own budget. Unions say costs linked to protection from Covid must not come from the education budget. Schools across Scotland have introduced a number of measures to try to protect staff and students. These include hand sanitisers and extra cleaning. Generally these costs are being met by councils centrally so are not placing a financial burden on schools or education budgets directly. But this has not always happened straight away. Extra costs One head teacher at a school in the west of Scotland said the costs of basic protection were having to be met from their school's own budget. They said their school was facing additional costs of about £20,000 - these included sanitising gel, toilet paper and masks. This could, they claimed, lead to less being spent on educational resources or supply cover. Separately, BBC Scotland has also heard of cases where schools have gone through more hand sanitiser than anticipated. In some cases schools may have had to order more. One teacher said they knew of cases where schools had been urged to be more sparing in the use of hand sanitiser. They said: ""Our school has bought some things ourselves - PPE and the like - but hand sanitiser is paid for centrally. Though I have heard of a school where a teacher was told to be more sparing. But who knows the context of that? We were told to be more sparing too but that was because some rooms were being so heavily sprayed it was making people cough."" Jim Thewliss of School Leaders Scotland, which represents senior school staff, said he was aware there were cases which ""were not happening as they should be happening"". ""There's an obligation on local government and on the Scottish government to make sure that schools are funded to deliver a safe environment and deliver an environment in which education takes place effectively and efficiently,"" he said. ""We're in a position at the moment of being under extreme pressure and there is a varied picture across the country in the way in which obligations are being carried out. ""We're aware there are local authorities where the level of support is consistent with the demand that's being made. There are others where discussions are ongoing."" Mr Thewliss also said he was getting ""feedback on the supply chain not delivering enough on time"". 'Support schools' Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS teachers' union, said it would be ""unacceptable"" for schools to have to divert money intended for educational expenditure into measures such as hand sanitisers in classrooms. He added: ""The Scottish government has made finance available for local authorities to support such provision and this must be used to support schools."" Most Scottish councils - including those covering the four main cities - have confirmed to BBC Scotland that the cost of hand sanitising gel and additional cleaning was being met out of their central budget. This means the cost does not fall to individual schools or have any direct implications for the education budget. The Scottish government has given councils more money to help them meet costs linked to the pandemic."
business-39193938,Budget 2017: What it means for you,Two Budgets in one year have the potential to make a major impression on your household finances.,"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter In the first of this double-header, Chancellor Philip Hammond said that he was supporting families while not spending recklessly. Although the Budget was relatively low-key, other changes were already planned. This adds up to a significant financial impact on millions of people - even before the next Budget in November. So here is how it could affect you. Tax rise for the self-employed The main National Insurance contribution rate paid by the self-employed will rise in the next few years. It will increase from its current level of 9% to 10% in April 2018, and then to 11% in April 2019 for those making a profit of more than £8,060. The level for employees for these Class 4 contributions is 12%. The chancellor said that this would raise £145m a year by 2021-22. On its own, the change announced in the Budget will leave 2.84 million people facing an average annual increase of £240. As previously announced, Class 2 payments - which have a lower threshold of £5,965 or more in profits a year - will be abolished. Taken together, only the self-employed with profits over £16,250 will have to pay more as a result of these changes - at an average cost of 60p a week to those affected. The chancellor said this brought more fairness between the self-employed and employees. But the move was criticised by the body that represents the self-employed. ""The chancellor should not forget that growth in self-employment has driven our labour market in recent years and punitive rises in tax will make many people have second thoughts about striking out on their own,"" said Chris Bryce, chief executive of IPSE. Shareholders hit Director shareholders will see a tax break reduced on the dividends they receive. The tax-free dividend allowance - which only came into force a year ago - will be reduced from £5,000 to £2,000 from April 2018. That will affect those who own a small business and pay themselves in dividends alongside a small salary. It will also hit people with large portfolios of shares. Experts say that with an Isa allowance of £20,000 available to use from April, many investors will not need to worry. Help for savers A new government-backed savings product was promised in November's Autumn Statement - but we did not have date or a rate. Now the chancellor has said the Investment Guaranteed Growth Bonds will be offered by National Savings and Investments from April, paying interest of 2.2%. The chancellor described this as a market-leading rate, which it is - but it is only the equal of the best-buy three-year bond on the market now. Critics have already labelled the product as a ""sideshow"" and ""underwhelming"". The bond will be open to those aged 16 and over, subject to a minimum investment limit of £100 and a maximum investment limit of £3,000. Savers must lock in their money for three years. Official forecasts estimate that the cost of living will rise at 2% or above for the next three years. Sin taxes There will be no change to previously planned inflation-linked increases in duties on alcohol and tobacco, but a new minimum excise duty is being introduced on the cigarettes targeting the cheapest tobacco. This, along with the previously announced measures, will mean a packet of 20 cigarettes will cost 35p more from 18:00 GMT on Wednesday. A 30 gramme pack of hand-rolled tobacco will cost 42p more. Subscriptions Concerns have been raised that many people are falling into a subscription trap, by signing up for a paid-for service without meaning to - for example, when a paid subscription starts automatically after a free trial has ended. Citizens Advice estimates that two million consumers each year have problems cancelling subscriptions on, for example, TV subscriptions. Those with mental health problems are often vulnerable to these issues. The chancellor confirmed that new measures will be considered in a Green Paper in the summer. What we already knew A long list of changes, announced in previous Budgets and Autumn Statements will come into force in April or the subsequent months. They include:"
uk-england-northamptonshire-53162075,Coronavirus: What will a re-opened pub be like?,"On 4 July pubs, cafes and restaurants will be allowed to reopen in England. But what awaits those venturing back out into these bastions of normal life?","By Laurence Cawley and Stuart BaileyBBC News The Willow and Brook is a village bar and restaurant sitting pretty much in the middle of England in the Northamptonshire village of Apethorpe, about 10 miles west of Peterborough. Imagine, just for a moment, today is 4 July and the pub is re-opening with certain restrictions. If you've booked a table, great, you can go to your seats. If not, you can only enter if there's a table free. At the entrance, there's a hand-sanitising station you need to use. Once inside, you'll hear soft piped music. The low volume is just enough to give a sense of ambience, says owner Suzanne Millar, but not so loud that anybody has to raise their voices. Raised voices mean more water droplets emanating from people's mouths and that increases the risk of infection transfer. Your table will be bare. Cutlery, napkins and menus will only be laid once you've taken your seats. And the staff member serving you will be a strange sight. Decked out in a plastic face shield, you might spot the personal hand sanitiser dangling from their waist clip. All food and drinks must be ordered from the table. Only staff are allowed at the bar because it is 75cm deep, too shallow to ensure social distancing can be safely observed. Getting to this point has been a ""rollercoaster"" for Mrs Millar and her husband (and head chef) Jim. They only got the keys to the establishment on 16 December before opening on 18 January. Two months later, they were forced to close. ""It was such a crushing moment, I just sat down and cried,"" said Mrs Millar. ""It has been a nerve-wracking time."" What about the rest of the UK? Each nation is setting its own rules for the reopening of food and drink outlets: With a background in NHS occupational health, Mrs Millar hopes she has planned for every eventuality with her re-opening plans. The layout has been altered slightly to ensure social distancing gaps of about 2m (6ft) between tables, each of which will seat a maximum of six people. The relaxation of social distancing guidelines in England from 2m to 1m plus has been welcome news for the pub. ""We can get more people in and we feel more secure knowing it's 1m plus,"" said Mrs Millar. Five hand-sanitising stations have been set up including one at the bar, one in the restaurant and outside the toilets. There are eight tables inside and four outside in the courtyard. Each member of staff will be responsible for the different areas, says Mrs Millar, to ensure staff can socially distance from one other. Normally the pub can hold about 30 people in the restaurant and 20 in the bar. This will now be reduced to about 20 in the restaurant and 10 in the bar. As well as wearing protective equipment - and being banned from wearing rings or watches - staff will have to wash their hands every 20 minutes for at least 20 seconds. And when a group leaves their table, it is not just the top surface that will be cleaned. ""We will be cleaning the chairs and table legs too,"" she said. ""Nothing on the table will be absorbent. ""We will be putting the table mats through the glass wash to make sure they are sterilised."" Gone are the laminated reusable menus. Instead, Mrs Millar has introduced single-use paper menus which will be destroyed after each sitting. If you need to use the toilet, a strict one-in, one-out policy is in place. ""We're not messing about,"" said Mrs Millar. ""We're putting the safety of our staff and customers first. I know from my NHS background how infections can spread and I just cannot contemplate having to close again."" Payment - preferably contactless - is done at the table. Those wanting to pay by cash will be presented with a tray on which to put their money before it is taken away and dealt with. Post-lockdown, the bar and restaurant will be closed every Tuesday while staff carry out a deep clean of the entire establishment. ""It is going to be different,"" Mrs Millar says. ""But I think it is mainly our staff who are really going to feel the difference because a lot of our processes and procedures are going to have changed."" Of course, the Willow and Brook is an independent bar and restaurant in a small village. So how will things look in the larger pub chains? Very similar though with a spot of extra technology, according to Nick Attfield, director of properties at Adnams, which runs 45 sites in the eastern region. ""We've got some online portals coming so you will have to book a table,"" he said. ""You will be met at the door or just in reception and shown to your table. ""And we've introduced some technology so all our menus will be online and there will be the opportunity to order online so we can try to minimise the contact as much as possible. ""And then we will have our staff in masks. I keep saying to my team that I don't want them to talk about social distancing. I want them to talk about physical distancing because we still need them to be social in hospitality."" Greene King, based in Bury St Edmunds, has 1,700 pubs nationwide and is introducing £15m worth of safety measures to protect customers and staff, changing the face of a ""normal"" pub experience in the process. Perspex screens and PPE, ordering by app, hand sanitising upon arrival, distanced tables and a one-in, one-out traffic light system for using the toilets, will be just some of the new changes. Only time will tell whether such measures will work and how many people feel comfortable venturing back out to their favourite pubs and restaurants. But for Mrs Millar, the signs are good. ""Our village and people in the surrounding villages have been absolutely amazing,"" she said. ""We're fully booked for 4 July. I cannot put into words what their support means to us.""

entertainment-arts-38601706,Did ye get healed? - How Van Morrison's music helped me recover my life,"I have a special connection to an enigmatic Belfast man whose music crosses jazz, blues, folk and rock.","By John McCarthyfor BBC World Service Radio In the late 1980s, I was held hostage in Beirut. Of my five years in captivity, four were spent with the Irish writer Brian Keenan. Stripped of virtually all external stimuli, we had to keep our minds and hearts going with memories. Two lonely men, we shared things that had touched us - books, films and music. Our soundscape then was as blank and depressing as the concrete walls of our cells. But music would emerge from our memories and we would hum snatches of songs as they came to us. Brian talked of traditional Irish music and of the great Belfast musician Van Morrison. I had never seen Morrison in concert but knew some of his hits - Brown Eyed Girl, Gloria and Moondance. But as Brian spoke, I somehow I felt as though I had stood with him in a crowded Belfast concert hall watching Morrison leaning into the microphone as he sang one of his soulful ballads - or throwing himself about the stage like a wild man, overwhelmed by the power of the music. Another world Morrison is only a few years older than Brian and was born only a few streets away in East Belfast. They went to the same school and came from the same modest backgrounds. Morrison's father had been a shipyard worker and they had grown up in near identical, small terraced houses. However, only a short walk away, was another world, a street lined with large villas called Cyprus Avenue. Morrison wrote about it on a track on his seminal album, Astral Weeks. Brian took me to these streets for the first time to record a BBC radio documentary, Van Morrison and Me. Two years ago, Morrison played a concert on Cyprus Avenue which Brian attended. He dedicated the song ""Motherless Child"" to Brian, something he has never forgotten and which deeply moved him. ""It's a song which has a very special significance for me. Chained to a wall, never knowing if you were ever getting out, ever going home, your whole sense of who you were evaporated. And you felt lost and lonely, a bit like a motherless child,"" Brian said. When I was finally released in 1991, I strove to come to terms with what had happened with the help of my girlfriend Jill Morrell, who had been campaigning constantly for my release. We settled in a cottage in the Oxfordshire countryside and Morrison's music became a key part of our liberation soundtrack. Jill and I tried to make sense of those extraordinary times, writing a memoir of my captivity and her campaign. One song particularly touched us both, and that was Wonderful Remark. I remember one night getting a magnifying glass to read the lyrics crammed onto the cassette's sleeve notes. As I read, I was stunned. Morrison's words seemed to capture the emotional heart of our experience over the hostage years: ""How can you stand the silence, that pervades when we all cry? How can you watch the violence that erupts before your eyes?"" How did he come to write that? I had met Morrison once or twice since my release at charity events and hoped that personal connection might help persuade him to speak to me about his music. So I was delighted when he agreed to meet me at the Culloden Hotel, a beautiful former bishop's palace on the outskirts of Belfast. When I asked him about Wonderful Remark, he told me that it was a song about hard times he had suffered in New York. He was short of money and felt stranded, a situation which contrasts to mine. But we both experienced similar feelings of frustration and sadness, as Morrison explained: ""It was a song about my circumstances but it was nothing compared to what you've been through. It was about people who were supposed to be helping you and they weren't there. ""It was about the business I'm in and the world in general. A lot of the times you can't count on anybody."" Brian took me from Cyprus Avenue to other locations which feature in Morrison's songs. Hyndford Street, where Morrison grew up and the nearby Beachie River. Brian told me he used to go there as a boy with his father: ""If we missed school, we'd go round there and catch frogs and newts. And it was a place where you could go courting where nobody could see what you were up to."" Ian Rankin is another writer who says he has been influenced by Morrison's music at an important moment in his life. In his mid-20s he was living in London, frustrated that he was not making progress as an author. He told me how, after suffering panic attacks, his doctor advised him to rest. So he grabbed a handful of Van Morrison cassettes and caught a train up to Scarborough to reflect on his life. ""It's very personal music and I thought here's someone who understands something of what I'm going through, they've seen highs and lows,"" he said. While Wonderful Remark is the stand-out Morrison song for me, Ian was most influenced at the time by tracks from Morrison's 1973 album Hard Nose the Highway: ""What I learnt was something about ploughing your own furrow. Don't let the world get in the way, if you want to be a writer, be a writer."" Ian decided to move to France to concentrate on writing novels. He has since written 21 Inspector Rebus books and become a world-famous author. Van Morrison - Sir Van Morrison now - is rightly regarded as one of the truly original songwriters and performers of his generation. His official accolades include two Grammys and an Ivor Novello award. One song - Someone Like You - has appeared in no less than seven Hollywood movies. But the real accolades are from the millions of people, like me, who have, time and time again, been moved by his songs. When I asked him how he had managed to touch so many people's lives, he said it was about working with the natural talent with which he had been born. ""I think it comes from God, whatever that concept is. A lot of people are given gifts and they don't develop them. I thought because I was given this gift, I had to develop it."" You can listen to John McCarthy reflect on Van Morrison's influence on his life on BBC World Service at 14:06 GMT on Saturday or on demand afterwards via iPlayer Radio."
magazine-35831125,Sugar tax: What is the UK's most sugary drink?,The government is to tax soft drink manufacturers who put large amounts of sugar in their products. But which fizzy drinks have the highest levels?,"By Justin ParkinsonBBC News Magazine The UK loves soft drinks. Altogether people got through 14.8 billion litres last year, or 232.9 litres each. In response to growing concern over obesity, Chancellor George Osborne is imposing a levy on soft drinks with more than 5g of sugar per 100ml. There's a higher rate for those with more than 8g per 100ml. Fruit juice and milk-based drinks are exempt. The Office for Budgetary Responsibility suggests the levy will add 18p or 24p per litre, or about 6p or 8p to a standard 330ml can. One of the highest levels of sugar is found in Old Jamaica Ginger Beer. Its Extra Fiery drink has 15.7g - or just under four teaspoons - of sugar per 100ml. The recommended maximum daily sugar intake for someone over the age of 11 is 30g a day, or 7.5 teaspoons. There are 13 teaspoons of sugar in a standard 330ml can of Extra Fiery, or 39 in a litre. Another very sugary product is the energy drink Rockstar Punched Guava, on 15.6g per 100ml. Old Jamaica Ginger Beer - the standard version - contains 15.2g per 100ml. There's a wide variation in the amount of sugar in products, Old Jamaica Ginger Beer Extra Fiery containing seven and a half times as much as Tango Apple. Cott Beverages, which makes Old Jamaica, says it's made ""using a traditional recipe, which includes authentic Jamaican root ginger, to create its trademark fiery taste"". It's ""designed to be a treat"" and there is a diet version available, a spokeswoman adds. ""We have removed billions of calories from the soft drinks we manufacture over the last few years and will continue to work with our retailer partners and own brands to provide great-tasting drinks."" Mountain Dew, Cherry Coke, Pepsi Cola, Red Bull, 7 Up, Coca Cola, Irn Bru, Vimto and Lucozade Energy Original are some of the other major products sugary enough to incur the higher-rate levy. Those set to go on the lower levy include Dr Pepper, Fanta Orange, Sprite and Schweppes Indian Tonic Water. But several products aren't sugary enough for a charge. These include Lilt, Tango Orange and R Whites Lemonade. Overall, the British Soft Drinks Association says the sector has reduced sugar levels by 13.6% since 2012. It calls the targeting of its members ""absurd"" at a time when ""sugar and calorie intake from all other major take home food categories is increasing"". It's also keen to point out that 57% of the soft drinks market is taken up by low and no-calorie drinks. Ian Macdonald, professor of metabolic physiology at Nottingham University, questions the need for the high levels of sugar in some soft drinks. ""What we are finding is that, where manufacturers are reducing the sugar content, it doesn't undermine the sweet taste."" Some manufacturers are adding sugar substitute stevia to their drinks to make up for a shortfall in sweetness when they reduce the sugar content, he says. But others are simply cutting the sugar. How much sugar is hiding in your food? The sugar tax will be levied from 2018, which the government says will give manufacturers time to change their products. Macdonald says most people wouldn't notice the difference if a product with eight or nine grams of sugar per 100ml had this reduced to six or seven grams. ""In the case of Old Jamaica, it may be that the ginger, which is fiery, tastes a bit bitter to many people,"" he says. ""In order to get the same sweetness level as you see in a cola or lemonade, you may need to add more sugar."" But even this could probably be reduced, he adds. The estimated £520m raised by the sugar levy will be put towards boosting primary school sports. The campaign group Action on Sugar has called for further penalties for drink manufacturers who don't reduce sugar levels ahead of the charges coming into force. Of course, fizzy drinks aren't the only soft drinks. But pure fruit juices and milk-based drinks will be excluded from the tax and the smallest producers will have an exemption. This would appear to cover Welch's 100% Purple Grape Juice which, with 16.5g of sugar per 100ml, has a higher rating than the Old Jamaica Ginger Beer Extra Fiery. And it's not just soft drinks firms that have faced criticism over sugar content. Action on Sugar reported last month that 98% of the 131 hot flavoured drinks found in the large High Street chains would carry a ""red"" warning for excessive levels of sugar. Starbucks' Hot Mulled Fruit - containing grape with chai, orange and cinnamon - contained 99g, or 25 teaspoons, of it. The chef Jamie Oliver, who campaigns for more education on food and drink, performed a celebratory dance outside Parliament after Osborne announced the tax in his Budget speech. Whether its effects live up to his expectations remains to be seen.

uk-34102536,Restaurant tipping abuse under investigation,"Business Secretary Sajid Javid has ordered an investigation into the ""abuse"" of tipping in restaurants.","This follows reports that some restaurant chains are regularly holding back some or all of the tips meant for their staff. The investigation will consider whether there should be a cap on the proportion of tips businesses can withhold. Trade union Unite opposes this, however, saying it would be ""impossible to enforce"". Mr Javid has ordered a formal call for evidence which will end in November. The investigation will look at how tips left by customers are handled after recent reports found that a proportion of tips at some restaurants were being spent on administrative costs. There is a voluntary code of practice but restaurants can adopt their own systems. 'Underhand practice' Unite officer Dave Turnbull said the union was pleased that ""the government has woken up to this scandal"" but an effective solution needed ""careful consideration"". ""Capping admin fees will simply legitimise the underhand practice of restaurants taking a slice of staff tips and be near enough impossible to enforce,"" he said. ""Rather than tinkering around the edges, Sajid Javid should be looking to scrap what is effectively a tax by restaurant bosses on money meant for the pockets of hardworking staff."" Mr Javid said the government wanted a ""fair deal"" on pay for working people and that this included ""taking action on tipping abuse"". ""I'm concerned about recent reports, suggesting some restaurants pocket tips for themselves. That's just not right,"" he said. ""I've ordered an immediate investigation to look at the evidence and consider the views of employees, customers and the industry to see how we can deal with the abuse of tipping."" Analysis by BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam Restaurants have the highest corporate mortality rate. They pop up and disappear from our high streets with daffodil-like regularity. That's because consumer tastes can change rapidly but also because profit margins are often very low. Add in high rents and staff costs in Britain's largest cities and restaurants will say they need to maximise every source of income to stay afloat. But consumers tend to side with waiting staff when it comes to tips. They assume staff will see most, if not all of them - especially if customers have been asked to pay an 'optional' service charge of at least 10% on their bill. Adding tips to the existing code of practice among restaurants (which is voluntary anyway) may be the solution. But it may be tough to police. Most waiting staff are either young or foreign - meaning they don't know the law and don't wish to upset their employers. As part of the investigation information and views from the hospitality industry and other key stakeholders will be sought. This will help the government decide if ministers need to intervene to strengthen the voluntary code of practice. Ufi Ibrahim, chief executive of the British Hospitality Association, said the body ""would welcome dialogue with the business secretary on the matter of tipping and the industry code of conduct."" Division of tips Most chains use a ""tronc"" system, where all the tips are collected together and distributed evenly through the staff, usually with around 70% going to the waiters, and the rest given to kitchen and other workers. There is no law regarding how a tronc is divided, however. A spokesperson for Pizza Express said: ""To cover the administrative costs of ensuring that the tronc system is managed correctly and fairly, a small administrative fee of 8% is levied. Under no circumstances does Pizza Express generate additional profit through the tronc."" Many high-street chains deduct fees from tips. These include: Ask (8%), Belgo (10%), Bella Italia (10%), Café Rouge (10%), Prezzo (10%), Strada (10%) and Zizzi (8%). Recently Giraffe has scrapped its 10% admin fee on tips, joining chains like Restaurant Group, Carluccio's, Garfunkel's and Jamie Oliver's who do not deduct a fee. Research from 2009 found that one in five restaurants did not pass tips to their staff, yet the vast majority of customers said they wanted waiting staff to receive the money left for them, the government said."
technology-28776282,Michael J Fox Foundation tests sensors to track Parkinson's,The Michael J Fox Foundation is attempting to use wearable sensors to monitor the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.,"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The charity has teamed up with Intel to equip patients with smartwatches which record continous data about them. The organisations carried out tests earlier in the year and now plan to release an app to help doctors study the effects of different medications. The effort has been given a cautious welcome by other researchers. The actor Michael J Fox created his New York-based foundation in 2000 after being diagnosed with the degenerative neurological disorder. It is believed that Parkinson's is brought on by a mixture of genetic and environmental factors, but the exact cause is still unknown. Its symptoms can include tremors and other uncontrollable movements, impaired balance and co-ordination, stiffness, slowness of movement, loss of smell, a decline in intellectual functioning, and speech and swallowing problems. It is estimated to affect about five million people worldwide and usually, but not always, occurs in old age. The link-up with Intel came about through the tech firm's former chief executive Andy Grove, who serves as a senior advisor to the foundation and has been diagnosed with Parkinson's himself. ""This opportunity really will allow us the chance to uncover novel breakthroughs in Parkinson's disease by truly understanding how people are living with the disease today, how are they responding to treatments, what are their unmet needs,"" said Todd Sherer, chief executive of the foundation. Record-keeping app The wearables study is intended to provide researchers with more accurate data than can be obtained via traditional, subjective methods. A preliminary test was funded by the two organisations earlier this year that equipped 16 Parkinson's patients and nine control volunteers with the devices for four days. The watches allowed more than 300 data points to be recorded every second, translating to one gigabyte of data per patient a day. The information was then uploaded to Intel's system by a smartphone carried by those involved. Over the period the participants kept paper-and-pen diaries and attended two clinical visits where they engaged in tests designed for the disease. Intel data scientists are still processing the findings. In addition to checking that the wearable tech's records correlate with those taken by the parties involved, they aim to develop algorithms that will allow body movement symptoms and sleep patterns to be automatically measured and made available for review in real time. The next phase of the study involves releasing an app that allows patients to record how they are feeling and to report their medication intake, to help scientists measure the efficacy of the drugs and inform medics when they are deciding prescriptions. This stage of the trial will be carried out in Boston, New York and Israel. ""We're looking for the accelerometer data,"" Ronald Kasabian, general manager of big data solutions at Intel, told the BBC. ""We want to be able to understand gait, fluidity of movement, tremors. ""The researchers are dying for the insight. The ability to see what is happening to the patient on a minute-by-minute, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year basis - the tremors, the sleep habits - to see that in real time will be one of the most eye-opening opportunities."" Intel said it would encrypt and anonymise the data to safeguard patients' privacy. It added that the intention was to eventually open up the platform to other research centres and wearable devices. 'Years not decades' Parkinson's UK welcomed the development, but cautioned that it was too soon to know how useful the results would be. ""The potential of using new technology to aid clinical decision making and help people with Parkinson's to get the right treatment is exciting,"" Suma Surendranath, professional engagement manger at the charity, told the BBC. ""However, it would be crucial that any device should demonstrate its effectiveness in robust clinical trials before becoming more widely available. ""New technology that has been proven to accurately represent the complexity of symptoms of people with Parkinson's could be a very useful addition to the tools currently available to professionals."" The Michael J Fox Foundation acknowledged that the study was still at an early stage, but it said it still believed a sensor-driven platform could be delivered within ""years and not decades"" to allow doctors to better tailor treatments to each patient. ""What happens is that you have 'on-off' periods as a patient,"" explained Sohini Chowdhury, senior vice president of research partnerships at MJFF. ""When you're 'on', your medication is working, you're able to move, you're able to do the tasks you want. When you are 'off' you are basically frozen, you can't do anything. ""The question treating physicians tackle with is: 'Are we giving you the optimal dose to be able to get you the right amount of on-off time during the day?"" Health tech Several other major tech firms have also announced plans to become more involved with health tracking tech. In May, Samsung unveiled Simband, a prototype wristband that can be fitted with third-party sensors to gather a range of data about the wearer's body that would then be shared with a platform called Sami (Samsung Architecture Multimedia Interactions). Then in June, Apple unveiled HealthKit - an app for its forthcoming iOS 8 operating system that is designed to gather data from a wide range of third-party sensors, which can contact health professionals if it notices irregularities. Later the same month, Google announced Google Fit, the Android-maker's own software to amass health-related data from other services and devices."
technology-31664948,HTC reveals virtual reality headset with Valve at MWC,"HTC is to release a virtual reality headset as part of a tie-up with Valve, a leading PC video games publisher.","By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The HTC Vive will be paired with wireless controllers and tracking technology to let wearers explore computer-generated environments by walking round their rooms. A test version of the kit will go on sale to developers shortly, followed by a public edition later this year. It will compete with Facebook's Oculus Rift and Sony's Morpheus VR headsets. The machines let wearers view computer-generated 3D environments to give them a sense of being there. The announcement marks a change of strategy for HTC, which has focused on smartphones. At a press conference in Barcelona on the eve of the Mobile World Congress trade show, the Taiwanese firm also unveiled a new flagship handset - the HTC One M9 - and a GPS-enabled fitness tracker Virtual gaming Only limited details of the Vive have been released ahead of a planned presentation by Valve at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco on Wednesday. However, HTC has said that the headset features can display video at 90 frames per second (fps) - an important consideration as many developers believe a rate lower than 60fps can cause nausea. It includes two 1,200 by 1,080 pixel screens to provide high definition - but not 4K - quality graphics, and allows existing sets of headphones to be plugged into its side. HTC said that more than 70 sensors were built in to the machine, including a gyroscope, an accelerometer and a laser position sensor. It added that the machine also supported a facility developed by Valve that allows users to explore a virtual space and the objects within it from different angles - by moving about in real life within a 15ft by 15ft (4.6m squared) space. To do this, owners will also need to buy a Steam VR base station. ""It is rare that a company has an opportunity to forever transform the ways in which people interact with the world and communicate with each other,"" said Peter Chou, HTC's chief executive. Although gamers are set to be the most likely early adopters, HTC added that the device could also be used for shopping, visiting other parts of the world and meeting friends in virtual reality. It added that Google, the US TV network HBO and movie studio Lionsgate were already working on content for the machine. Half Life VR? While HTC's handsets have been well reviewed in the past, its relatively small marketing budget has played to rival Samsung's favour. Samsung already sells virtual reality kit of its own, thanks to an alliance with US firm Oculus VR. However, the Gear VR relies on the user also owning either a Samsung Galaxy Note or a Galaxy S6 handset, and as yet has little content available. US-based Valve runs Steam - the hugely popular online marketplace for PC videogames - as well as developing renowned games of its own, including Half Life, Portal and Dota 2. A link-up with Valve therefore offers HTC a way to promote its machine without having to fund all the associated costs. But one expert suggested the relationship could be a double-edged sword. ""Valve has a huge amount to offer a consumer electronics company through its giant user-base and the content distribution platform it runs,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls from the IHS Technology consultancy. ""But on the flipside it must make sense commercially, and it is an issue if the hardware company doesn't have a share of the content revenues."" Phone and fitness One company watcher was less positive about the firm's new Android-powered handset. The look of the all-metal unibody One M9 has hardly changed from that of its predecessor. However, its main camera has been upgraded to a 20 megapixel component that can shoot video in 4K ultra high definition (UHD) quality. HTC's Sense user interface has also been updated to provide location-specific news and suggestions on the phone's home screen. And the handset can now simulate a surround sound experience from its front-facing speakers. ""These are just small incremental changes,"" commented Francisco Jeronimo, from the research firm IDC. ""HTC needs to do a lot more to retain market share."" The company shipped 21.3 million smartphones in 2014, giving it a 1.6% share of the market, according to IDC. That was down from a 4.4% share and 31.6 million shipments two years earlier. It did, however, manage to return to profit last year after cutting costs. The firm also unveiled a wristband, which is compatible with both Android and iOS handsets. The HTC Grip fitness tracker contains a built-in GPS chip to track the user's location, helping it measure their pace and calorie burn during exercise. It is waterproof and features a 1.8in (4.6cm) OLED display that can show incoming calls and notifications to a linked phone, but lacks a heart rate monitor. ""The problem is that there are lots of other wristbands out there at a cheaper price,"" said Mr Jeronimo. ""So, unless HTC bundles it for free when someone buys the M9 I don't see how it will succeed."""

If cyclists are going too fast and unable to stop properly they would be charged with dangerous or careless cycling. The Traffic Regulation Order comes into force at 00:01 on Sunday. Rural west Edinburgh is also included in phase 1 with signs and lines for the new 20mph speed limit having been installed. Large 20mph signs will mark the entrance and exit of a 20mph area. These will be supplemented by smaller signs or road markings with speed limit roundels. The 20mph network will be introduced over six phases. Phase one of the £2.2m project covers much of the city centre, from Queen Street to the Meadows. Lesley Hinds, Edinburgh's transport convener, said: ""Slower speeds bring many benefits to the urban environment, making streets more people-friendly, promoting active travel (and thereby improving public health) and reducing the risk and severity of road collisions. ""The majority of Edinburgh residents support our 20mph scheme and we know that other local authorities in the rest of Scotland are closely monitoring our experience. ""Changing driver behaviour is not an overnight thing, obviously, and it will take a bit of time for it to become second nature. ""We'll continue to help people adapt to the new limit throughout the rollout, through awareness raising and education campaigns."" Ch Insp Mark Rennie, of Police Scotland, said: ""We remain committed to casualty reduction on our roads and whenever we observe motorists disobeying the 20mph speed limit, or where the public tell us there is an ongoing problem, we will respond appropriately.""

uk-politics-53525450,"Coronavirus: We could have done things differently, says PM","Boris Johnson has admitted the government did not understand coronavirus during the ""first few weeks and months"" of the UK outbreak.","The PM told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg there were ""very open questions"" about whether the lockdown had started too late. Mr Johnson also spoke of ""lessons to be learned"" and said ministers could have done some things ""differently"". Labour accused the government of ""mishandling"" the crisis. More than 45,000 people in the UK have died after testing positive for coronavirus, government figures show, with almost 300,000 cases confirmed. Last week, Mr Johnson promised an ""independent"" inquiry into the pandemic, but no details have been given of its scope or timing. Previously, the prime minister has said he took the ""right decisions at the right time"", based on the advice of scientists. But, in an interview with Laura Kuenssberg to mark the first anniversary of his entering Downing Street, he said: ""We didn't understand [the virus] in the way that we would have liked in the first few weeks and months. ""And I think, probably, the single thing that we didn't see at the beginning was the extent to which it was being transmitted asymptomatically from person to person."" Mr Johnson wants to use the government's experience of what happened during the pandemic to speed up his agenda, to ""double down on levelling up"", as he puts it in his peculiar political jargon. In other words, to push ahead with more determination, and less fudge in Whitehall, with the changes that he says will actually improve the lives of voters, particularly those who voted Tory for the first time in 2019. While preparing the NHS for a potential second surge, he clearly wants to concentrate on what's next, not what's gone before. But perhaps until the government is really ready to acknowledge what has happened, the questions will continue - and the public may still feel anxious about whether they can really trust ministers to handle a second surge next time round. Just as 366 days ago, optimism is Boris Johnson's trademark. But if the last few months have shown anything, it is that the real challenge of life in power, is that events that can surprise. The prime minister added: ""I think it's fair to say that there are things that we need to learn about how we handled it in the early stages...There will be plenty of opportunities to learn the lessons of what happened."" The UK went into full lockdown in late March, which critics say was too late and cost lives. Mr Johnson said: ""Maybe there were things we could have done differently, and of course there will be time to understand what exactly we could have done, or done differently."" He added that these were still ""very open questions as far as [scientists] are concerned, and there will be a time, obviously, to consider all those issues"". On Friday, the government announced that 30 million people in England would be offered a flu vaccine this year, to reduce pressure on the NHS in case of a surge in coronavirus infections during the autumn and winter. Mr Johnson said this was in addition to increased testing and tracing and more procurement of personal protective equipment, adding: ""What people really want to focus on now is what are we doing to prepare for the next phase."" He said: ""We mourn every one of those who lost their lives and our thoughts are very much with their families. And I take full responsibility for everything that government did."" The prime minister, who was himself placed in intensive care in April after contracting coronavirus, said he would ""very soon"" set out new measures to deal with obesity, seen as an added risk factor for patients. 'Doubling down' In December, Mr Johnson's Conservative Party pulled off a convincing general election win over Jeremy Corbyn's Labour, after promising to ""level up"" all parts of the UK. And, despite the economic damage caused by coronavirus in the past four months or so, the prime minister promised more nurses, doctors, hospitals and police, saying his government's priorities were ""exactly what they always have been, except more so. We're doubling down."" ""The agenda is what it was when I stood on the steps of Downing Street a year ago, but we want to go further and we want to go faster."" Mr Johnson reminisced about first entering No 10 as prime minister on 24 July 2019, saying it ""was very exciting, and everybody seemed to be in a very good mood"" and ""happy, upbeat"". He added that coronavirus had caused many ""difficulties"" since then. ""Psychologically it's been an extraordinary time for the country,"" Mr Johnson said. ""But I also know that this is a nation with incredible natural resilience, and fortitude and imagination. And I think we will bounce back really much stronger than ever before."" For Labour, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""Boris Johnson has finally admitted the government has mishandled its response to the coronavirus. ""It was too slow to acknowledge the threat of the virus, too slow to enter lockdown and too slow to take this crisis seriously."" The threat of a second wave of infections was ""still very real"", he added, while it was ""imperative the government learns the lessons of its mistakes so we can help to save lives"". Acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said an ""immediate"" coronavirus inquiry was ""essential"", and that the prime minister had shown ""no remorse"" for his ""catastrophic mistakes""."
world-middle-east-43098229,Iranian wrestler Karimachiani banned for throwing match,Wrestling's global sporting body has banned an Iranian athlete for six months for deliberately throwing a match to avoid an Israeli opponent.,"Alireza Karimachiani was winning a match against his Russian opponent in November's under-23 world championships when his coach ordered him to lose. If he had won, he would have faced an Israeli athlete in the next round. Iran does not recognise the state of Israel and bans its athletes from competing against Israelis. Iran's wrestling federation has said it will challenge the ban, which was announced by the United World Wrestling Disciplinary Chamber on Friday. ""Karimachiani, on instruction of his coach Jamshidi, wilfully lost his 1/8 finals match against Alikhan Zhabrilov,"" the chamber said, referring to the Russian opponent in the match. ""Both wrestler and coach were found to have acted in direct violation of the International Wrestling Rules... and the UWW Disciplinary Regulations,"" it added. Karimachiani's ban was set to run for two years from the date of the incident - making him eligible to compete in late May 2018. His coach, Hamidreza Jamshidi, was also banned from the sport until the end of November 2019. During the November 2017 match-up in Poland, Karimachiani was leading 3-2 in the fourth minute of the match. Winning would have set him up against Israel's Uri Kalashnikov in the next bout. Footage of the match appeared to contain a man's voice shouting instructions to lose, before the match is briefly paused for an exchange between athlete and coach. In the final 45 seconds, Karimachiani is tackled to the ground before he rolls over and over, resulting in his opponent winning 14-3. Many Iranians took to social media to express outrage at the spectacle. More than 5,000 tweets were sent following the match with hashtags which translate as #lose_alireza, #I_am_telling_you_to_lose, and #you_must_lose."
uk-england-leicestershire-51021358,Rutland: McDonald's-free county set to get restaurant,Plans for a drive-through McDonald's restaurant in England's only county without the golden arches are set to be given the go-ahead.,"Officers have recommended proposals for the restaurant on the outskirts of Oakham, in Rutland, are approved by councillors. A planning committee is meeting on 14 January to decide on the application. McDonald's says the restaurant will create 35 full-time and 30 part-time jobs. Rutland County Council has so far received 23 representations of support and 55 objections for the restaurant off Lands End Way. Some residents fear the fast-food restaurant will adversely affect the character of the country's smallest county. Robert Kent, who lives in Oakham, has registered an objection to the application. He said: ""I think in an area of outstanding natural beauty and a traditional market town, adopting the banality of the golden arches would be a sad day."" There is also concern about litter the restaurant might create. Resident Stewart MacDonald said: ""I'm against this proposal as a McDonald's restaurant will bring with it a significant litter problem in the surrounding area including around Rutland Water. ""While McDonald's will undoubtedly keep their site clear, they will not clear their discarded packaging from Oakham."" Lisa Shaw is one of many who have given their seal of approval to the restaurant, saying she could ""only see this as a positive addition"". She said: ""Oakham needs all the help it can get for youth employment and McDonald's would provide that. ""I don't believe there would be an increase of litter issue or anti-social behaviour issues."" McDonald's has previously said it understands the ""historic nature"" of Oakham town centre.

entertainment-arts-19344568,Last Night of Proms in 3D cinemas,The Last Night of the Proms will be screened live and in 3D in selected cinemas for the first time next month.,"The traditional finale to the BBC Proms is one of the world's most popular classical music concerts. Cinemagoers are being encouraged to ""pack your flags and warm up your singing voices"" ahead of the event on Saturday 8 September. The concert will feature Nessun Dorma and You'll Never Walk Alone before the traditional patriotic climax. Czech conductor will lead the orchestra, and the audience, in Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance, Sir Hubert Parry's Jerusalem, and the National Anthem. The programme also features Scottish violinist Nicola Benedetti and Maltese tenor Joseph Calleja. Eight 3D cameras will capture the concert, which is watched and listened to by millions around the world. The BBC said cinema audiences would have ""the best seats in the house"" with key cameras in front of the conductor and a remote camera within the orchestra. Highlights of this year's BBC Proms - which feature two months of music at London's Royal Albert Hall - have included a Wallace and Gromit prom and the event's first Brazilian orchestra, who flew in from Sao Paulo. A selection of Odeon cinemas across the UK will broadcast the live 3D experience, including Bath, Belfast, Sheffield and Wimbledon. A full list can be found on the BBC website. The Proms in the Park event also allows those not at the Royal Albert Hall to experience the world-famous Last Night celebrations. Events are held in London, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland, with each show centred around a live concert before a live big-screen link-up to the main event for the traditional singalong. Kylie leads the lineup in London's Hyde Park this year, joined by English tenor Alfie Boe, operatic pop group Il Divo, the London Community Gospel Choir and the BBC Concert Orchestra."
technology-49126035,Three to give customers 5G at 'no extra cost',"Mobile operator Three says it will offer 5G on all its new and existing tariffs at no extra cost, when it launches its next-generation service.","By Chris FoxTechnology reporter Existing customers will be able to use 5G at no extra cost - if they have a compatible handset - while new contracts will include 5G as standard. One analyst said Three's pricing had ""undercut"" rivals Vodafone and EE. Both have already launched a 5G service in some major cities but Three will not launch its service until August. As well as faster download speeds, one of the benefits of 5G is increased network capacity. In theory, it should mean an end to network congestion in busy areas such as pop concerts or festivals. EE launched its 5G service in May. Currently its cheapest Sim-only 5G tariff costs £32 a month, but it comes with a 20GB data download cap. Vodafone offers a Sim-only tariff for £23 a month, but limits the download speed to 2 Mbps, making it slower than 4G. It charges £30 a month for true full-speed 5G. Three says it will offer unlimited data without a speed limit for £22 a month, the same price it currently charges for its 4G tariffs. The network told the BBC there was ""absolutely no throttling"". ""Our 5G is completely unrestricted and there no catches,"" a spokeswoman said. On Monday, Three was criticised after it refused calls from the industry regulator Ofcom to automatically cut its customers' monthly charge at the end of their contract's lock-in period. As a result, Ofcom said Three's subscribers would ""overpay"" unless they took action to change to another deal. ""The UK is rapidly becoming the most competitive market for 5G and Three's announcement raises the ante once again,"" said Kester Mann, an analyst at the CCS Insight consultancy. ""It is surely only a matter of time before all four UK operators offer unlimited 5G data."" Mr Mann said 5G was ""crucial"" for Three because it provided ""an opportunity to reinvigorate the brand, overcome a negative network perception [and] achieve the scale it has long-for craved"". But he warned that the price war made it ""increasingly challenging for operators to make a significant return on the huge investment required"". O2 will be the last of the major networks to launch a 5G service. It plans to switch on its offering in October. It will be the only network to offer 5G without using equipment from the embattled Chinese telecoms equipment-maker Huawei. O2 has not yet announced its pricing."
uk-29331740,Dave Lee Travis found guilty of indecent assault,Former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis has been found guilty of indecently assaulting a researcher working on TV's Mrs Merton Show in 1995.,"A Southwark Crown Court jury convicted him by a majority verdict of 10-2. He was found not guilty of indecently assaulting a woman while he was appearing in a production of Aladdin in 1990. Travis, who left the court with his wife Marianne after being granted bail, will be sentenced on Friday. He was cleared of a further charge of sexually assaulting a journalist after the jury failed to reach a verdict. Travis was cleared of the two charges he was being retried for after a jury was unable to reach verdicts at an earlier trial. He had been cleared of 12 other indecent assault allegations at that trial. The prosecution introduced a further charge ahead of the retrial and, on Tuesday, the court found him guilty of this offence. 'Charming' persona The 69-year-old, who was tried under his real name David Griffin, appeared on BBC Radio 1 for more than 25 years until 1993 and was a regular host of Top of the Pops. Prosecutors described him as an ""opportunist"" and said his ""charming and cuddly"" persona was no defence for his actions. Sophie Wood, defending, told the judge she would ""seek to persuade"" him that Travis should be given a non-custodial community order sentence. But Judge Anthony Leonard QC told Travis: ""You must understand that all my options remain open in relation to sentencing."" Travis replied: ""I understand. Thank you, your honour."" In court Danny Shaw, BBC News Dave Lee Travis had to wait a long time to learn his fate. Almost two years since his arrest, eight months since the first trial and four days since this jury began their deliberations. The strain was etched on his face as he entered the dock at 14:15 BST this afternoon. He stood as the jury forewoman delivered the verdicts. Not guilty on the first count. Guilty on the second. Unable to agree on the third. But it was only the second count that really mattered. The man with the soothing voice, patter and quick wit seemed lost for words and walked out of the courtroom alone, stunned. His wife Marianne, who'd been sitting grim-faced in the public gallery behind him, put an arm round his waist. But it was little consolation. 'Left shaking' The jury of six men and six women found him guilty of indecently assaulting a woman on 17 January 1995, while she was working on the BBC's comedy chat programme the Mrs Merton Show. She had told the court she was left ""shaking"" after the incident. Giving evidence, the woman - now a television personality - said she was 22 when Travis approached her as she was smoking a cigarette in a corridor of the BBC studios in Manchester. Travis, a guest on the programme, told her she ""shouldn't be smoking"" and gave her a ""squeezing grope"", she said. ""He started touching the bottom of my rib cage. Without saying anything else he just slid his hands up to and over my breasts and then kind of left them there and started squeezing,"" she added. She told the court: ""I absolutely knew he had some weird sexual thrill from this. I felt like I'd been punched, that feeling of being violated."" In court, Travis, of Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, accused the woman of lying. Jurors were read a transcript of his police interview when the allegation was put to him. ''I remember the days people used to touch people and you would kick them in the balls,"" he had told the officers. 'You didn't take them to bloody court.'' But the woman's account of having raised the assault incident at the time was backed up by comedian Dave Gorman, a scriptwriter on the show, and the producer Peter Kessler, who told the jury they remembered her claims clearly. Operation Yewtree Travis was found not guilty of putting his hands inside the trousers of a woman who was working on the pantomime Aladdin in 1990. And the jury failed to reach a verdict on an allegation that he groped a journalist's chest when she interviewed him at his home in 2008. Jenny Hopkins, deputy chief crown prosecutor for the CPS in London, said in a statement: ""David Griffin, also known as Dave Lee Travis, indecently assaulted a young woman by touching her in a way that was not only deeply invasive but also against the law. ""We thank the jury for their careful consideration in this case and we respect all the verdicts of the court today. ""The prosecution of sexual offences is often difficult and complex, perhaps even more so when the allegations are from some years ago. ""We will continue to consider cases and, wherever there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest, we will work with police to build strong cases which can be put before the court."" Travis was arrested in November 2012 as part of Scotland Yard's Operation Yewtree, which was set up after abuse allegations against the late BBC DJ and entertainer Jimmy Savile. Entertainer Rolf Harris and publicist Max Clifford, who were also arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, are both serving sentences for a number of indecent assaults."
world-middle-east-35807689,Syria conflict: Russia's Putin orders 'main part' of forces out,"In a surprise move, Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his military to start withdrawing the ""main part"" of its forces in Syria from Tuesday.","He said the Russian intervention had largely achieved its objectives. The comments come amid fresh peace talks in Geneva aimed at resolving the five-year Syrian conflict. Russia is a key ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, whose office said in a statement he had agreed to the move. The pullout was ""in accordance with the situation on the ground"", the statement said. Russia began its campaign of air strikes in Syria last September, tipping the balance in favour of the Syrian government and allowing it to recapture territory from rebels. ""I consider the mission set for the defence ministry and the armed forces on the whole has been accomplished,"" Mr Putin said in a meeting at the Kremlin. ""I am therefore ordering the defence ministry to begin the withdrawal of the main part of our military force from the Syrian Arab Republic from tomorrow."" Putin may be hedging his bets: Sarah Rainsford, BBC Moscow correspondent When Russian air strikes began in Syria, President Assad's regime was on the brink of collapse. Less than six months later, Russia says its action allowed Syrian government troops to retake 10,000 sq km (3,860 sq miles) of territory. By intervening, Vladimir Putin made clear that Russia was prepared to assert its interests. The results ensure Moscow a bigger say in what happens at the peace talks. The decision to scale down Russian operations may partly be fuelled by cost, given falling oil prices; it could also be driven by a desire to end Russia's isolation and Western sanctions. But whilst Vladimir Putin has ordered his foreign minister to focus efforts on the political front in Syria, he appears to be hedging his bets. Critically, sophisticated air defence systems seem set to stay. And as we have never been told officially how many troops were ever sent to Syria, we are unlikely to know how many will remain. Mr Putin said that Russia's Hmeimim air base in Latakia province and its Mediterranean naval base at Tartus would continue to operate as normal. He said both must be protected ""from land, air and sea"". Syria's opposition cautiously welcomed the Russian announcement. ""If there is seriousness in implementing the withdrawal, it will give the [peace] talks a positive push,"" said Salim al-Muslat, spokesman for the opposition umbrella group, the High Negotiations Committee. The US also gave a guarded response. ""We will have to see exactly what Russia's intentions are,"" said White House spokesman Josh Earnest. President Obama has discussed the development with Mr Putin in a phone call, the White House and the Kremlin said, giving few details. What did Russia achieve in Syria? Source: Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu, quoted by Russian media Separately, US officials said Washington had received no advance warning of Mr Putin's statement. BBC diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says Russia has achieved its main goals in the intervention - consolidating President Assad's position, enabling his forces to re-take key pieces of strategic territory and ensuring that Mr Assad remains a factor in any future Syrian settlement. Russia has long insisted its bombing campaign only targets terrorist groups but Western powers have complained the raids hit political opponents of President Assad. The UN's envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura has meanwhile described the latest peace talks as a ""moment of truth"". He said there was no ""plan B"" should the talks fail, with the only alternative a return to war. A cessation of hostilities agreed by most participants in the conflict began late last month - but there have been reports of some violations on all sides. In the latest fighting, Syrian government forces are reported to have advanced on so-called Islamic State's (IS) positions near the world heritage site of Palmyra."
business-50047229,US treasury chief Mnuchin in China tariff warning,"New tariffs on $156bn of Chinese goods will be imposed if a trade deal is not finalised by 15 December, the US Treasury Secretary has warned.","Steven Mnuchin said he still hoped a tentative US-China deal agreed last week to suspend fresh tariffs would be formally approved. But his caution, during a CNBC interview, seemed in contrast with President Trump's optimism last week. Wall Street shares dipped at the open on worries about reaching a final deal. Last Friday, the US agreed to hold off on a planned 25%-30% tariff increase on Chinese imports that was due to come into effect on Tuesday. It followed two days of talks in Washington between Liu He, China's vice-premier, and US officials. President Donald Trump, who described the talks as a ""love fest"", said the preliminary deal would take about five weeks to complete. He added that he might sign the deal alongside Chinese President Xi Jinping at a United Nations summit in Chile in December. However, Chinese officials have been more cautious about the outcome, simply claiming there had been progress between the countries. US officials also warned last week that tariffs on a different set of Chinese goods, which are due to go into effect in December, remained an option. Still talking Mr Mnuchin told CNBC: ""I have every expectation if there's not a deal, those tariffs would go in place - but I expect we'll have a deal."" There are still major issues to be negotiated, including industrial subsidies and cybertheft. Mr Mnuchin said more trade negotiations at various levels would take place over the coming weeks, including a phone call between himself, US Trade Representative Lighthizer, and Mr Liu. Despite the treasury secretary's caution, analysts said it still look as if talks were progressing. ""Investors are trying to wrap their head around this 'non deal',"" said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth, in New York. ""If (the market) was really sceptical, it would be selling off a lot harder. But it's not because there are some good points to it - that they are still talking and potentially reaching a deal."" Asked on CNBC about a dispute between China and the US National Basketball Association, stemming from a tweet by Houston Rockets manager Daryl Morey expressing support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, Mr Mnuchin said he hoped the two sides could come to a solution."
technology-16616803,ACS: Law solicitor Andrew Crossley suspended by SRA,"Andrew Crossley, the controversial solicitor who sent thousands of letters to alleged illegal file-sharers, has been suspended from the profession for two years.","At a disciplinary tribunal he was also ordered to pay costs of £76,326.55. The court heard how Mr Crossley used his law firm ACS: Law to demand money in recompense for alleged copyright infringements. The scheme unravelled when several cases went to court. The Solicitors' Regulation Authority (SRA), which brought the case against Mr Crossley, welcomed the decision to uphold the allegations against Mr Crossley. ""Some of those affected were vulnerable members of the public and this matter has caused them significant distress,"" said an SRA spokesman. ""We hope that it serves as a warning to others. Solicitors have a trusted position in society and therefore have a duty to act with integrity, independence and in the best interests of their clients,"" he added. It has taken two-and-a-half years for the case to come before the Solicitors' Disciplinary Tribunal. The allegations included ""acting in a way that was likely to diminish the trust the public places in him or in the legal profession"" and ""using his position as a solicitor to take unfair advantage of the recipients of the letters for his own benefit"". In mitigation, Mr Crossley said that he had already suffered as a result of the work he had undertaken and was now bankrupt. He said he was in danger of having his house repossessed and that his 15-year relationship had broken down because of the case. Judge angered Mr Crossley began the so-called speculative invoicing scheme in May 2009. In total he sent about 20,000 letters to people identified as having downloaded content, often pornography, without paying for it. He claimed he was acting on behalf of MediaCAT, which in turn represented the copyright owners. The letters threatened court action unless the recipient paid a one-off fee of about £500. Consumer group Which? was one of the first to highlight the cases of people who claimed that they had been wrongly accused and had been upset by the threatening nature of the letters. When a handful of cases came to court, the scheme came in for widespread derision, angering the presiding judge, Judge Birss, who turned the spotlight on Mr Crossley, accusing him of abusing the court process. The lawyer for the defendants likened the case to Charles Dickens' Bleak House. 'Disappointed' In a further twist, the ACS: Law website was hacked and huge amounts of sensitive data were exposed during attempts to get it up and running again. Mr Crossley was fined by the Information Commissioner's Office for the data breach. James Bench, founder of campaign group Being Threatened?, set up to represent those who received letters from ACS: Law, said he was pleased by the findings of the disciplinary hearing. ""The judgement will provide some satisfaction to those innocent members of the public that Mr Crossley relentlessly bullied in the operation of this scheme,"" he said. ""It was clear to all that Mr Crossley's speculative invoicing scheme lacked any legal merit,"" he added. But he said that he was disappointed that the case had taken nearly three years to reach a conclusion. It was revealed during the hearing that the SRA had asked Mr Crossley to stop the scheme within days of him setting it up, but he had refused."
uk-england-essex-51240530,Stansted Airport expansion rejected by Uttlesford council,Expansion plans for Stansted Airport have been rejected by councillors.,"Officers at Uttlesford District Council had recommended approval of proposals to increase the Essex airport's passenger cap to 43 million a year. But at the council's special planning committee, members rejected the scheme, 10 votes against with two abstentions. Airport bosses said they were disappointed the council had ignored the advice of its own officers. An airport spokesman said: ""From the outset, we have listened to local communities to put forward an application that delivers the benefits of growth and a comprehensive package of mitigation measures to benefit local communities."" He said the airport will look at the ""comments made by the planning committee before deciding our next steps"". Originally the council approved the plan, but after the Residents for Uttlesford group took control from the Conservatives in May, the decision was referred back to the committee. Residents for Uttlesford leader of the council John Lodge said: ""Expanding Stansted up to the size of Gatwick is unnecessary as it can continue to be a major employer and contributor to the regional economy without this expansion."" Denise Rossiter, chief executive of Essex Chambers of Commerce, said: ""It is extremely disappointing that Uttlesford's councillors have once again adopted a negative attitude towards Stansted's ambitions for the future."" Council officers had said there were no new material considerations to justify a different decision from the one made in November 2018 when the plans were approved. Stansted currently handles 28 million passengers a year and already has permission to increase capacity to 35 million. The airport had offered to invest £35m in the local area, including on transport, soundproofing for homes on the flight path and homeowner relocation. Plans for a new £150m arrivals terminal were put on hold last year."

Polling experts said Labour was likely to be the biggest party after the election, but with fewer seats. Plaid Cymru was marginally ahead of the Conservatives in second place. UKIP looks likely to win regional seats and could affect some constituency results. On constituency votes the data, compiled for the Welsh Election Study, puts Labour on 34% (no change since February), Conservatives 22% (no change), Plaid Cymru 21% (+2), UKIP 15% (-3), the Liberal Democrats 6% (+1) and others 3% (+1).

science-environment-36781197,Solar Impulse: Zero-fuel plane lands in Cairo,"The Sun-powered aircraft Solar Impulse has finished its penultimate flight, landing in Egypt's capital, Cairo.","By Jonathan AmosBBC Science Correspondent It took off from the Spanish city of Seville at 04:20 GMT on Monday, taking just over 48 hours to make the trip. The zero-fuel aircraft is now in the home straight of its bid to circumnavigate the globe. Its final stop is Abu Dhabi, where the challenge began in March 2015. The two pilots sharing flying duties are each taking one more turn at the controls. Andre Borschberg did the Seville-Cairo stage, soaring over the pyramids and the Sphinx at Giza before landing. ""The final approach to Cairo was a bit tough but I made it,"" he tweeted. Bertrand Piccard will complete the challenge by taking Solar Impulse back into the United Arab Emirates in the next few days, depending on the weather. Towards the end of the flight, it was the first time the plane's battery levels had gone under 30%, mission managers said. They organised to land in Egypt, where they were greeted by the country's ministers of aviation and energy, in the morning when the winds and temperatures were most favourable. Before taking off from Seville International Airport, Mr Borschberg said he inevitably felt the emotion of making his last journey in the plane. ""It's meaningful obviously because it's my last flight in this round-the-world epic. I've started to think about it. I'm happy that we get close to the end but also prudent knowing that it is not done yet. I have to stay really focussed."" The penultimate leg crossed seven countries, negotiating some very busy air routes. The slow-moving plane also had to take account of a number of military operations in the Mediterranean/North Africa region. For Mr Piccard, reaching Egypt is an important milestone for the project he founded. It was in the North African nation that he landed 17 years ago in Breitling Orbiter 3 - the first balloon to make a non-stop, round-the-world flight. ""We arrived there with so little fuel left - you know, the propane gas you have to burn in your envelope to stay airborne. I landed there with less than 1% of our reserves, and I was really scared to fall short of gas before the end. And that's when I said I want to fly around the world again but with no fuel,"" the Swiss adventurer said. Mr Piccard and Mr Borschberg have been working on the Solar Impulse project for more than a decade.

But not everyone was tuning in to watch the much anticipated announcement, on Tuesday night Mr Trump's detractors were using #blackoutTrump to encourage others to watch alternative programmes or do ""something meaningful"". The element of suspense has clearly been on Mr Trump's mind as he tweeted the build up to the revelation but for some live streaming a major announcement was a step too close to the drama normally associated with The Apprentice. New York Times columnist Roger Cohen in his tweet about the announcement added ""ratings are all he lives for."" But while some felt the reality show style was inappropriate, others thought it reflected his desire to speak """"directly to the people"". For Mr Trump's supporters calls to boycott the announcement of Neil Gorsuch as a new Supreme Court judge was a big fuss over nothing. ""Leftists, how about waiting until President Trump actually announces his #SCOTUS pick before losing your minds?"" responded one fan. British MP under fire A conservative MP's opposition to a private bill that seeks to protect women against honour killings has faced backlash on social media, with some men arguing honour crimes can also apply to male victims. The bill, proposed by fellow conservative Nusrat Ghani, suggests prohibiting the use of the term honour crime in official publications. But Philip Davies MP, who sits on the Women and Equalities Committee, opposed the bill on the grounds it does not mention ""honour-based violence against men"". As Davies stood on his feet to speak, BuzzFeed UK's news editor Alan White tweeted: """"It is with a heavy heart that I must announce that Philip Davies MP is at it again.""."" Others also disagreed with the MP's stance saying his position was not defensible. But there was some support for Mr Davies on Twitter: ""Good on Philip Davies MP for standing up for the rights of all victims of domestic abuse rather than just one gender"". Tears of victory? Moroccan social media has been buzzing with news about the country's return to the African Union after it left in dispute in 1984. Many are sharing pictures of their king's participation in the union's summit held in Adis Ababa with much praise. But it was one picture of the summit that proved particularly intriguing. The picture, in which King Mohammed VI looks as if his cheeks are wet with tears after he delivered a speech to the union members was shared on a Facebook page known for publishing photos of the king, sometimes exclusively. It was initially captioned: ""the tears of coming back to the African homelands"". Comments applauding the king and his tears of ""nobility"" and ""victory"" poured in. And soon the issue of the King's tears became an online discussion point. One blogger wrote that the king ""could not hold in the tears after his solemn speech before heads of state of the African Union on 31 January"". But despite the reaction being overwhelmingly supportive the page admin's later clarified that what appeared to be tears was ""clearly only the reflection of light on the king's face.""

Jacob Schilt Seagulls supporter Mr Schilt was travelling with his Mavericks teammate Matthew Grimstone when their vehicle was hit by the aircraft. Alongside Mr Grimstone, Mr Schilt was part of Worthing United's Sussex County League Division Two championship-winning side last season, and also played for an Albion supporters' team in this year's Robert Eaton Memorial Fund (REMF) match against Crystal Palace at Lewes in April. Brighton & Hove Albion Football Club paid tribute to him, with chairman Tony Bloom saying: ""The thoughts and prayers of everybody at the club are with Matt and Jacob's family and friends at this shocking time. Our thoughts are also with all the people who have lost loved ones in this horrendous accident."" Chief executive Paul Barber added: ""I got to know Jacob as one of the REMF squad, during the coaching sessions we held leading up to this year's charity match against Crystal Palace. As well as being a very good footballer, Jacob is a popular and impressive young man."" Worthing United FC released a statement, saying: ""Jacob, who was 23 years of age, small in stature and a tenacious midfielder, was very skilful with an eye for goal."" ""At this point we don't know how or if we will cope with this. Worthing Utd is a family, part of the football family, we have been moved by the number of tributes to them that we have received form our fellow clubs and from the public."" Mr Schilt and Mr Grimstone attended the same secondary school, Varndean, leaving in 2008. The school said in a statement: ""It is with great sadness that we remember former students Matt Grimstone and Jacob Schilt who died tragically at the weekend in the Shoreham Airshow crash. ""Jacob's father, Bob Schilt, was a teacher at the school from 1989 to 2009 and is remembered affectionately by staff who knew him."" Matt Jones Matt Jones, 24, a personal trainer, was named on Facebook by his sister Becky Jones as one of the dead. She wrote: ""Thank you to everyone who has messaged me. We are devastated to say Matt Jones was one of the fatalities."" Maurice Abrahams Chauffeur Maurice Abrahams, 76, from Brighton, was driving his ""beloved Daimler"" when the plane crashed. It has been widely reported that he was on his way to pick up a bride for her wedding. His family issued a statement through Sussex Police: ""Maurice is a well-respected and loved father and husband. He enjoyed his work chauffeuring his beloved Daimler car and he enjoyed gardening. ""He was proud to have served in the Grenadier Guards and the Parachute Regiment. He served in Cyprus and Bahrain with the UN. In his 30s he served as a police officer with Hampshire Police."" Mark Reeves The family of Mark Reeves, 53, said he died while combining two of his favourite hobbies, riding his cherished Honda motorbike to photograph planes at an air show. He was a computer-aided design technician in west London who fundraised for cancer charities by parachuting and abseiling. His family said in a statement: ""Mark Reeves - motorbiker, golfer, photographer, fund-raiser - but above all else, son, brother, husband, father and grandfather. ""As many times before, he had travelled to an air show and parked up on the outskirts to grab the best photos, but he had never been to the Shoreham air show before. 'Family man' ""We will remember him as a gentle, loving, incredibly giving family man, husband to Wendy, father to Luke, granddad to three beautiful grand-daughters, brother to Denise and loving son of Ann and Kenneth. ""With his family he moved to Seaford nine years ago, drawn by our love of the sea and for Mark in particular, love of the sun. ""He was a sun worshipper and an enthusiastic holidaymaker, travelling to Fuerteventura and Madeira in recent years and would often be seen relaxing with a cocktail in hand. ""We thank everyone who has sent their love, condolences and prayers and while we appreciate that many others will be experiencing similar unspeakable grief in such tragic and public circumstances, that we now be allowed to grieve ourselves in private and in peace."" Tony Brightwell The family of Tony Brightwell, 53, from Hove, said he was enjoying his passion of watching planes and cycling before he died. Outside of being a health care manager for Sussex Partnership NHS and Brighton and Hove City Council, he was an aircraft enthusiast and had learnt to fly at Shoreham airfield. With his pilot's licence, he had attended the airfield many times and was hoping to fly again one day. His fiancee Lara said she is heartbroken that their ""plans to spend their lives in the sun will now never happen"". ""I watched him cycle off into the sun on his treasured ridgeback bike to watch the air show at Shoreham for a couple of hours, but he never came home,"" she said. Daniele Polito Daniele Polito was in the same car as Matt Jones, when the Hawker Hunter plane crashed and exploded on the A27 in West Sussex. Posting on Facebook, his sister Marina said: ""I miss you loads already little (big) bro! Keep making people smile."" Ms Polito said that many people loved her brother and would ""miss him loads"". ""I would just like to say a massive thank you to every one who has supported my family over the last few painful days. ""I am overwhelmed by the kindness you have all shown. I know many people loved him and will miss him loads, ""As long as we keep him in our hearts and memories, he will never really leave us."" Mark Trussler Window cleaner and builder Mark Trussler is thought to have been riding his motorbike on the A27 when the plane crashed on Saturday. His fiancee Giovanna Chirico posted a message on Facebook saying that her worst fears had been confirmed. She wrote: ""Yesterday my worst fears were confirmed and I lost not just my fiance but my best friend, soul mate and sidekick. ""No words can describe how much all ur family and friends r going to miss u. ""So glad I got to spend the last 12 years of my life with u an love u always and eternally."" Dylan Archer Dylan Archer was on a cycle ride with his friend Richard Smith when he died in the crash. Mr Archer, an IT company director, was raised in the Midlands and came to live in Brighton in 1991. He leaves a partner, Alice, and their two sons aged 15 and 12. The family said in a statement: ""Dylan was a kind and loving father, partner, brother, grandson and friend. His dry humour and generous nature will be greatly missed by all who knew him. ""The family are very touched by all the tributes, and thank everyone for their kindness and generosity."" Richard Smith Richard Smith, 26, from Hove, was brought up in Buckinghamshire before going to university in Birmingham. His family moved to Hampshire in 2008 and he worked in a cycle shop in Cosham. He moved to Hove two years ago where he worked in marketing and web development. His family said: ""Richard's passions in life were for his family, friends and his beloved bikes. His boundless enthusiasm was infectious. He was a truly wonderful, caring and loving person. He will be so sorely missed by all who knew him."" He leaves a partner Victoria, parents Julie and Jonathan, and brothers William and Edward. Graham Mallinson Retired engineer, Graham Mallinson, 72, had been hoping to capture shots of the Vulcan bomber which was making one of its last appearances at Shoreham Airshow when he was killed. The keen photographer from Newick, East Sussex, was described as being ""at the right place at the wrong time, doing what he loved best on a beautiful summer's day,"" when the jet crashed. In a statement, his family said: ""He was the kindest and most generous man, who regularly gave his time to help others. Always loyal and reliable, he was a private and loving family man with a great sense of humour. ""A very caring husband and father who was dearly loved, he will be very sorely missed by all his family and the wide circle of friends who had the good fortune to know him."""

technology-54360612,Trump ads push baseless Biden earpiece conspiracy,US President Donald Trump's re-election campaign is running hundreds of Facebook advertisements pushing an unfounded conspiracy theory that Joe Biden cheated during the first US presidential debate.,"By Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation reporter, BBC News The adverts show the Democratic Party challenger with an earpiece, and say that he refused to have his ears checked for devices prior to the debate. The Biden campaign rejected the claims. The Trump campaign adverts ask: ""Why won't Sleepy Joe commit to an ear test?"" and ""Who is in Joe's ear?"" Accusations that presidential candidates have received debate help via hidden hearing devices are familiar, albeit unproven. Such allegations have been levelled against both Republican and Democratic candidates in the past. Prior to Tuesday's debate, the rumour about Mr Biden's supposed earpiece was circulating on several social networks, and was being promoted by the Trump campaign. At least 15 versions The advertising campaign was launched after the debate, and also promotes two other baseless but widely shared rumours about Mr Biden. One suggested he asked for breaks during the debate, and another accused him of refusing a ""drug test"". The photo featured in the advert is not from Tuesday's debate. It was first shared online in September 2019. In a number of the adverts, it has been doctored to show Mr Biden wearing wireless Apple headphones. This was not the case in the original image. Some versions circle the ear featuring the headphone. By Wednesday evening, there were at least 15 different versions of the advert, and according to Facebook's Ad Library, they had reached at least 10 million users. Facebook has pledged to label posts containing voting misinformation and point users towards accurate information ahead of the election. However its policy does not involve fact-checking political speech, including in advertisements. The company declined to comment about the latest Trump ad campaign. Rumour origins Hours before the debate, the claims went viral on Facebook and YouTube. Identical memes were pushed by a number of popular Facebook pages with names such as US Conservative and Unhinged Left. They claimed ""Joe Biden should be inspected for a hidden earpiece as well as submit to a drug test before the debate"". These memes are subject to fact-checks - and some have had warning labels applied to them on Facebook. The claims were picked up by Fox News and other conservative news outlets. They were further amplified by supporters of QAnon, an unfounded a conspiracy theory that claims President Trump is fighting a secret war against elite Satan-worshipping paedophiles. Those who believe in QAnon are known for promoting political disinformation on social media which targets opponents of the president. They shared close-up pictures of Mr Biden's ears, alleging a listening device was visible. During the debate, some also shared photos of a fold in Mr Biden's shirt, claiming it was caused by a wire, and of a supposed device on his wrist, where he wears a rosary in memory of his late son Beau. Nothing new Conspiracy theories about secret listening devices have been recycled in presidential election campaigns for the past two decades. Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton faced similar unfounded claims ahead of the 2016 presidential election. In 2004, rumours circulated among left-wing sites and blogs that President George W Bush was being aided by a secret earpiece. None of those allegations were found to be true. Even if a candidate did wear an earpiece, any advantage would be questionable. As TV and radio presenters can attest, listening to someone while simultaneously talking during the back-and-forth of a live event is a difficult skill to master."
magazine-35350886,Are beards good for your health?,"If you were in search of a new, disease-fighting antibiotic, where might you start? In a swamp? A remote island? Well, how about combing beards? Michael Mosley investigates.","On Trust Me I'm a Doctor we do experiments which sometimes throw up genuinely new science. In a previous series, for example, we discovered you can cut the calories in pasta by cooking, cooling and then reheating it. That was a very pleasing result. But our most recent discovery, finding bacteria which appear to be producing a novel form of antibiotic, feels altogether more significant. What was particularly delightful was that they were found growing in someone's beard. Beards, as you may have noticed, are back. The chin-strap, the goatee, the neck beard and the Van Dyke, they all have their fans. But with beards sprouting everywhere, like new grass in the spring sunshine, there has inevitably been a backlash. Critics claim that beards are not only an irritating affectation but can potentially harbour unpleasant bugs. So, what's the evidence that beards pose any sort of health risk? Pogonophobes, people who fear beards, had those fears confirmed by a recent study in New Mexico where they found traces of enteric bacteria, the sort usually found in faeces, in randomly sampled beards. As one newspaper put it: '""Some beards contain more poo than a toilet."" But is this typical? A recent and rather more scientific study, carried in an American hospital, came to very different conclusions. Find out more Trust Me I'm A Doctor is on BBC Two at 20:00 on Wednesday 20 January - catch up on BBC iPlayer In this study, published in the Journal of Hospital Infection, they swabbed the faces of 408 hospital staff with and without facial hair. They had good reasons for doing so. We know that hospital-acquired infections are a major cause of disease and death in hospitals, with many patients acquiring an infection they didn't have when they went in. Hands, white coats, ties and equipment have all been blamed, but what about beards? Well, the researchers were surprised to find that it was the clean-shaven staff, and not the beardies, who were more likely to be carrying something unpleasant on their faces. The beardless group were more than three times as likely to be harbouring a species known as methicillin-resistant staph aureus on their freshly shaven cheeks. MRSA is a particularly common and troublesome source of hospital-acquired infections because it is resistant to so many of our current antibiotics. So what's going on? The researchers suggested that shaving might cause micro-abrasions in the skin ""which may support bacterial colonisation and proliferation"". Perhaps. But there was another more plausible explanation staring them in the face. That beards fight infection. Unlikely? Well, driven by curiosity we recently swabbed the beards of a random assortment of men and sent them off to Dr Adam Roberts, a microbiologist based at University College London, to see what, if anything, he could grow. Adam managed to grow over 100 different bacteria from our beards, including one that is more commonly found in the small intestine. But, as he quickly explains, that doesn't mean it came from faeces. Such findings are normal and nothing to worry about. A brief history of beards Far more interesting, in a few of the petri dishes he noticed that something was clearly killing the other bacteria. The most obvious suspect was a fellow microbe. We see microbes as our enemy, but they clearly don't see us that way. Down at their level bacteria and fungi spend their time competing with each other. They fight for food, resources and space. By doing so, over millennia, they have evolved some of the most sophisticated weapons known to microbe-kind - antibiotics. Penicillin was originally extracted from Penicillium notatum, a species of fungus. The microbe-killing properties of this fungus were discovered by Alexander Fleming when he noticed that a fungus spore, which had accidently blown into his lab from researchers further down the corridor, had killed some bacteria he was growing on a petri dish. So could our mysterious microbes be doing something similar? Killing fellow bacteria by producing some sort of toxin? ""Yes,"" says Adam extremely cautiously. ""Possibly."" Adam indentified the silent assassins as part of a species called Staphylococcus epidermidis. When he tested them against a particularly drug-resistant form of Eschercichia coli (E. coli), the sort that cause urinary tract infections, they killed with abandon. Purifying and properly testing a novel antibiotic is so expensive and has such a high failure rate that it is extremely unlikely doctors will be prescribing Beardicillin any time soon, but Adam is deadly serious about looking for replacements for our current stock of antibiotics. As he pointed out, antibiotic-resistant infections kill at least 700,000 people a year, projected to rise to 10 million by 2050. There have been no new antibiotics released in the past 30 years. As well as our beardy findings, Adam's team have recently isolated, from microbes sent in by the general public, anti-adhesion molecules which stop bacteria binding to other surfaces. They think there may be potential for adding this to toothpaste and mouthwash, as it could stop acid-producing bacteria from binding to enamel. Surprising, isn't it, what you can find in a beard?

technology-42562303,"Intel, ARM and AMD chip scare: What you need to know",Nearly all computers worldwide - and many other devices - have been exposed to security flaws which leave them vulnerable to attacks by hackers.,"Researchers discovered gaps in security stemming from central processing units - better known as the chip or microchip - which could allow privately stored data in computers and networks to be hacked. So far no data breaches have been reported. So is it a big deal and what does it mean for you? What are the bugs? There are two separate security flaws, known as Meltdown and Spectre. Bryan Ma, a senior analyst at technology consultancy IDC, says data centres and devices that connect to the cloud are also at risk. How big is the problem ? First, let's not panic. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said there was no evidence that the vulnerability had been exploited. But now that it has been made public, there's concern the bugs are discoverable and may be taken advantage of. The BBC understands the tech industry has known about the issue for at least six months - and that everyone involved, from developers and security experts had signed non-disclosure agreements. The plan, it seems was to try to keep things under wraps until the flaws had been fully dealt with. Consider the figures for personal computers alone: there are 1.5 billion in use today (desktop and laptop combined) and around 90% are powered by Intel chips, IDC estimates. That means exposure to the Meltdown bug is potentially huge. What information is at risk? The bugs allow hackers to potentially read information stored on a computer memory and steal information like passwords or credit card data. Technology analyst Jake Saunders from ABI Research said it was not exactly clear what information might be at risk, but as the security gaps had been exposed ""the question is whether other parties can discover and potentially exploit them"". How do I protect my computer? Device makers and operating system providers have had time to try to fix this. They are pushing out security updates, or patches, which will protect your computer, tablet or phone against a breach that uses the Meltdown vulnerability. Users should install these updates as soon as they are made available. Microsoft, Apple and Linux, the three major operating system makers, are all issuing patches. Apple has said that all Macs, iPhones and iPads are affected by Meltdown, but Macs running the latest version of macOS, numbered 10.13.2, are safe. The same is true for the latest iOS version 11.2, which is used on iPhones and iPads. Apple said it will release updates to mitigate against Spectre ""in the coming days"". Microsoft released an emergency Meltdown patch for Windows 10 on 4 January via Windows Update. This will subsequently also be applied to Windows 7 and 8 machines. However, users with third-party anti-virus or security software should also check that this has been updated first, in order for the Windows Update process to install the patch. Google said Android phones with the most recent security updates are protected, and users of web services like Gmail are also safe. Chromebook users on older versions will need to install an update when it comes. Chrome web browser users are expected to receive a patch on 23 January. Cloud services for businesses, including Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform, say they have already patched most services, and will fix the rest soon. Spectre is thought to be much harder to patch and no fix for it has yet been made widely available. Will the fix slow down my computer? Some researchers have claimed that any fixes could slow down computer systems, possibly by 30%, but Intel believes these claims are exaggerated. It said any performance impacts were ""workload-dependent"" and the impact for average computer users ""should not be significant"". IDC's Mr Ma agreed that for most regular users - who rely on their computer for web browsing and email - the security fixes were unlikely to slow their computer. How will the tech industry react? News about the bugs comes at an awkward time for the industry. Next week, CES, the giant consumer electronics trade show, kicks off in Las Vegas. Many attendees will be wondering how the new products on display will be affected, and marketing materials detailing speed increases will likely have to be revised. Experts also think that because Meltdown and Spectre reveal fundamental flaws in how computer chips are designed, there will have to be a serious rethink about how such technology is made in the future. ""It's huge in the geek world,"" wrote computer security researcher Rob Graham on his blog. ""We'll need to redesign operating systems and how CPUs [central processing units] are made."""
business-12402793,Universal Credit benefit details 'imminent',"Details of a major overhaul of the benefits system will be published ""imminently"" in a government bill, a committee of MPs has heard.","This will outline exactly which benefits and tax credits could be replaced by the proposed Universal Credit system. Work Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has been taking questions from the Work and Pensions Committee. If given the go-ahead, the system will start for new claimants in 2013. However, it will take 10 years for the changes to come into effect fully. Simplification The government is planning to simplify the UK benefits system, claiming that universal credits would ""make work pay"". It wants to consolidate the existing 30 or more work-related benefits - such as jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit, child tax credit, working tax credit, income support and employment support allowance - into a single universal payment. But there has been debate over exactly which of the dozens of benefits will fall under the umbrella of the Universal Credit system. Mr Duncan Smith told the committee that the bill would outline whether benefits such as carer's allowance would be included, adding that the publication of these details was imminent. ""The current system is a pretty near nightmare to negotiate,"" he said. ""We are pretty well ready [to publish the bill]."" He added that this would include details about carers who currently faced losing their allowance if their earnings reached more than £100 a week. Mr Duncan Smith also said he wanted families to decide themselves exactly where the single universal payment would be made - such as into a joint bank account, or to a man or woman in a household. The plan was for a monthly payment, as this was similar what happens in a workplace. Many benefits are paid every two weeks, at present. Winners and losers The government has insisted that nobody will experience a reduction in the benefit money they receive as a result of the introduction of the Universal Credit. A recent report by the Institute of Fiscal Studies (IFS) suggested that 1.4 million families would notionally lose money as a result of the government's reforms. But it also calculated that the changes would help 2.5 million households. It said that those on lower incomes would be most likely to benefit. But some charities have raised concerns about the planned changes. ""There is a real danger that lone parents with young children will not be able to work their way out of poverty as is possible under the present benefits and tax credits system,"" said Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy. Under the plans, there would be stricter rules for people losing their payments if they refused a job, with those who do so three times losing their benefits for three years. Part of the committee's discussion was how job centre staff would be able to find out all of the key details that would affect people's benefit claims. Some of the information from new claimants will be entered online, if they are able to access the internet, before a face-to-face interview with an adviser. People could also input details on terminals at benefits centres. A review of online use is being conducted among existing benefits claimants at present."
uk-england-merseyside-48112981,Brexit Party candidate criticised for past IRA defence,"The father of a murdered schoolboy has criticised a top Brexit Party candidate over ""absolutely disgraceful"" comments about the Warrington IRA bombing.","European elections candidate Claire Fox was a leading member of the far-left Revolutionary Communist Party (RCP) which defended the fatal attack. Colin Parry, whose son Tim died in the 1993 bombing, said she ""should disavow these comments if that's her position"". A Brexit Party spokesman said Ms Fox ""does not hold those views now"". Tim Parry, 12, and Johnathan Ball, three, were killed in the IRA bombing on March 20, 1993, which left 56 others injured. The RCP defended ""the right of the Irish people to take whatever measures necessary in their struggle for freedom"" in the party's newsletter published shortly after the killings. Mr Parry, who set up the Tim Parry Johnathan Ball Peace Foundation with his wife Wendy to provide conflict resolution and victim support, said Ms Fox should explain her position. He added: ""For somebody to come out with comments I believe she made, and being an apologist for the IRA, is absolutely disgraceful. ""If this woman would care to explain her comments back at that time to me and my wife, I would like her to do so."" Ms Fox is the number one candidate in the north west of England for Nigel Farage's Brexit Party, and if the polls are correct, likely to become Warrington's MEP. Warrington councillor Dan Price, one of Change UK's candidates for the European elections, said Ms Fox was ""totally unfit for office"" and ""should come to Warrington and explain to the Parry family her views on the IRA atrocity that devastated our town."" A spokesman for the Brexit Party said Ms Fox does not deny she did hold those views in the past, but that she supported the Good Friday Agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland. He added: ""It's a desperate attempt to cause trouble. That was 20 years ago and she is committed to democracy and peaceful solutions."" Ms Fox said in a statement she felt the ""greatest sympathy"" for the Parry family for the ""tragic"" loss of their son and it ""must have been terribly painful, as for all victims of violence during the Troubles"". She added: ""My political views have never made me insensitive to the pain and suffering caused to the innocent victims of events such as the Warrington bomb."""
world-europe-32486426,Ireland's divisive referendum on same-sex marriage,Voters in the Republic of Ireland will take part in a national referendum on 22 May on legalising same-sex marriage.,"By Claire BrennanBBC News The vote marks a pivotal moment in the evolving relationship between Church and State, pitting religious leaders against the government in an historically conservative and Catholic country. The Church has urged the public to reject the proposal, while the major political parties say it is a civil not a religious matter and are campaigning for a Yes vote. Opinion polls suggest 78% of people are in favour of altering the constitution to allow gay couples to marry. But former Equality Minister and government Chief Whip Pat Carey believes the final result will be much closer. ""In the major urban centres the Yes campaign is getting a good reception,"" he told the BBC. ""But a lot of people in middle Ireland and among an older age group still don't feel comfortable about it."" Mr Carey came out earlier this year aged 67. He says his decision was not borne out of ""bravery"" but a desire to ""energise"" the Yes campaign. ""I am sorry I didn't speak out earlier but I didn't have the confidence or the courage,"" he said. ""It seems to have resonated with a lot of people in my own age bracket. I have got some very sad letters. There is a great deal of torment out there."" Gay rights in Ireland 2015 Ireland votes on 22 May 2013 Cabinet agrees to same-sex marriage referendum 2011 First same-sex civil partnership takes place 2010 Civil Partnership Act introduced 1993 Homosexuality de-criminalised Raising a family Homosexuality was illegal in Ireland until 1993, and Mr Carey believes a generation of gay men and women now deserve ""some generosity"" from the Irish people. Catholic bishops and family rights campaigners argue that a Yes vote would encroach on religious beliefs and have implications for the welfare of children. Keith Mills, an agnostic, gay man and member of the Mothers and Fathers Matter group, believes gay and lesbian couples are already catered for by the Civil Partnership Act of 2010, and have adequate next of kin and taxation rights. Same-sex marriage would lead to gay couples adopting and using surrogates, he believes, depriving children ""of a mother and father"". ""Marriage is the gel that brings a couple together to raise a family. That should not be redefined,"" he added. 'This feels personal' Rory O'Neill, an LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) activist and drag queen considers such arguments ""constitutionally bogus"". ""The referendum asks if two people should enter in to marriage regardless of their sex. It has nothing to do with surrogacy or adoption or gay families,"" he added. Last year, Mr O'Neill hit international headlines when he made an impassioned speech about homophobia; dressed as his alter ego Panti Bliss. ""This feels personal. Referendums in Ireland, especially on social issues, always get a bit nasty,"" he told the BBC. Why is Ireland holding a referendum? Heated debate The two sides' positions have become deeply entrenched. Activists from the No camp say they are regularly ""shouted down"" by their Yes side opponents, while LGBT campaigners say they have been subjected to demeaning posters and pamphlets, including one that likened voting for same sex marriage, to voting for Sharia. Mr O'Neill believes the issue should have been dealt with in parliament, rather than in public. ""I would have much preferred if it had happened through legislation. Now we are having to argue that we are ordinary, good people and the whole country gets to decide. ""It's actually a horrible situation to be in."" Michael Kelly, editor of the Irish Catholic newspaper, says the eventual outcome will depend on turnout. He will be voting No on the day, as he believes marriage is ""a unique institution between a man and a woman"". ""A lot of the Yes vote is quite soft,"" he said. ""While there is a lot of warmth towards this, people don't feel that strongly about it."" Pat Carey will spend the next few weeks trying to galvanise voters, in the hope that he can one day marry his partner. ""A woman said to me the other night, 'Pat will you marry me?'.

He was one of 13 gang members sentenced at Bristol Crown Court following offences committed during 2018/2019. Judge Michael Longman said the town ""changed for the better"" after the arrests. Brooks, of Park Road, received the longest sentence of the 13 men, being handed 12 years for drugs offences, and 13 years for aiding and abetting 13 counts of rape. Criminal empire Devon and Cornwall Police said the group ""exerted significant influence and control within Dawlish and Teignmouth"" and ""used violence and coercive tactics to maintain a criminal empire valued at £1m"". Det Ch Insp Nick Wilden said some members had been a blight on communities for 10 years. Officers seized a variety of weapons during their investigation, including firearms, knives and knuckledusters. Seized mobile phone footage also showed them assaulting people over drug debts, police added. Sentencing after a four-month trial, Judge Longman said the men had ""made an unwelcome mark on the town to detriment of law-abiding individuals"". He added there was ""no doubt"" Brooks was the ""prime mover of these conspiracies"". Prosecutors also paid tribute to the courage of three rape victims who gave evidence against men who exploited them. One man in the town, who wanted to remain anonymous because of fear of reprisals, told the BBC that there had been a ""definite atmosphere of fear"". He said: ""There was a seething undercurrent of, 'We don't want this here, but we don't know what to do about it'. ""It's [now] like a blight has been lifted."" As well as Brooks, those jailed included: The 13th man: Lewis Williams, 20, of Springwood Avenue, Garston, Liverpool, was given a two-year sentence, suspended for two years, for conspiracy to supply cannabis and possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply.

health-35324450,HIV drugs give couples 'ray of hope',The most effective form of protection against contracting HIV is to use a condom while having sex. But what if you want children? A project in Kenya is helping couples there have a family without risking their health.,"By Chris PittBBC News John and his wife Josephine live a few hours north of Nairobi. Josephine is HIV positive, John is negative. He says such situations can be difficult. ""I've known couples who have separated"", he says. There are 260,000 couples in Kenya where one partner is positive and the other negative. Known as serodiscordant couples, they account for 44% of new HIV infections in the country. The drive to have children is still very strong - in one recent study involving serodiscordant couples 16% of the women became pregnant. Now a new way of using anti-HIV drugs called PrEP - normally given to people who are HIV positive - could potentially mean couples could try and conceive risk-free. Dr Nelly Mugo from the Kenya Medical Research Institute in Nairobi and a team from Washington University have been running a trial. ""The Partners PrEP study took over 4,700 couples, one of whom had HIV, and one who didn't. The person who wasn't infected took PrEP over the course of 36 months. ""We found that having the drug in your system reduced the rate of transmission by over 90%. ""If the positive partner was also taking antiretroviral drugs, the risk of transmission would reduce to zero or close to zero"" In some communities social pressure to have children can be huge, with families of childless couples often struggling to understand why they haven't had children. 'Nowhere to hide' In a recent study couples described feeling helpless and vulnerable to HIV while trying to conceive. Uninfected partners were relieved when they remained uninfected after unprotected sex, which for some reinforced a belief in divine protection. Dr Mugo says: ""Common motivations for child-bearing included fulfilling the couples' preferred family size, desire for biological children, maintaining partnership stability and, often most importantly, external pressure from society."" HIV is incurable because, once in your body, it hides in inaccessible places, creating reservoirs, which means it can never be flushed out. The theory behind PrEP is that taking the antiretroviral drugs before becoming infected means they are already in the body. But researchers have shown that if a non-infected person already has the PrEP drugs in their system when the virus enters their body it gets killed. This means it doesn't have a chance to hide in reservoirs, and so its harder for that person to become infected. ""PrEP is the best thing that can happen for these couples"" says Dr Mugo, because it could solve what she calls the ""discordance dilemma"". ""When you find out your partner is HIV positive it can lead to conflicting emotions,"" she adds. ""But relationships and feelings and love are stronger than the virus. ""With many couples they want to stay together, but are unable to have normalised sexual relationships. PrEP has the potential to solve this problem."" The trial was a success. As of September 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that people at substantial risk of HIV infection should be offered PrEP as an additional prevention choice, as part of comprehensive prevention. PrEP has also recently been approved by the Kenyan and South African drugs regulators - so the future is looking a little brighter."
uk-30327893,Foetal alcohol syndrome case dismissed by Court of Appeal,"A child born with foetal alcohol syndrome is not legally entitled to compensation after her mother drank excessively while pregnant, the Court of Appeal has ruled.","The seven-year-old girl was born with severe brain damage and is now in care. Lawyers argued her mother had poisoned her foetus but appeal judges ruled she had not committed a criminal offence. The case was brought by a council in the North West of England, which cannot be named for legal reasons. It had been argued the woman ignored warnings and drank a ""grossly excessive"" amount of alcohol while pregnant. She consumed eight cans of strong lager and half a bottle of vodka a day, the court heard. Three appeal judges at the Court of Appeal had to rule on whether or not the girl was entitled to a payout from the government-funded Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme as a victim of crime. But Lord Justice Treacy said an ""essential ingredient"" for a crime to be committed ""is the infliction of grievous bodily harm on a person - grievous bodily harm on a foetus will not suffice"". 'Hugely important' case The girl, who cannot be named and was referred to in court as CP, suffers with learning, development, memory and behavioural problems. BBC News legal correspondent Clive Coleman said the case was significant because it centred on whether or not a foetus was considered a person, independent of its mother. He said: ""This case was hugely important, because campaigners argued that if the Court of Appeal had said it was possible for a mother to commit a crime by poisoning her foetus with excessive alcohol, it would have had the effect of criminalising pregnant women who drank excessively, knowing the dangers of alcohol to their foetus."" Foetal alcohol syndrome Heavy drinking during pregnancy can lead to foetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Alcohol passes across the placenta from the mother to the developing foetus. But the foetus cannot process alcohol effectively until the liver is fully developed and the high levels of alcohol can affect the development of organs and the brain. Children with FAS are born with a range of disabilities, are often shorter than average and some have learning and behavioural difficulties. People with the syndrome can have differences in their facial features such as a flat nose bridge, a small head and a thin upper lip. It is thought that foetuses are most at risk during the first three months of pregnancy when organs are forming - but damage can occur at any time. John Foy QC, representing the council that has responsibility for CP, told the court her mother drank the equivalent of 40-57 units of alcohol a day. National Institute for Health and Care (Nice) guidelines suggest 7.5 units daily might damage a foetus. Mr Foy said the young mother, for whom it was a second pregnancy, was aware of the dangers, adding: ""She was reckless as to whether there would be harm to the foetus. ""She foresaw that harm might be caused but went on to take the risk."" Ben Collins, appearing for the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) had asked the court to reject the legal challenge, telling the judges: ""There is a conflict of ideas about what is or is not dangerous, not only in terms of drink but also in terms of smoking and food."" He asked whether ""a pregnant mother who eats unpasteurised cheese or a soft boiled egg knowing there is a risk that it could give rise to a risk of harm to the foetus"" could be accused of a crime. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (Bpas) and the childbirth charity Birthrights welcomed the ruling. Rebecca Schiller, co-chair of Birthrights, and Bpas chief executive Ann Furedi said it was ""an extremely important ruling for women everywhere"". ""The UK's highest courts have recognised that women must be able to make their own decisions about their pregnancies,"" they said. ""Both the immediate and broader implications of the case were troubling. In seeking to establish that the damage caused to a foetus through heavy drinking was a criminal offence, the case called into question women's legal status while pregnant, and right to make their own decisions."" 'Wake-up call' Neil Sugarman, the solicitor acting for CP, said the decision was ""clearly disappointing"" and that the case was not about women's rights or ""criminalising women"". He said GLP Solicitors, of which he is managing partner, represents about 80 other children with FAS and that they would now be looking at the implications of the ruling. The only legal option left is to seek to take the case to the Supreme Court. Julia Brown, chief executive of the Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) Trust, told the BBC the case highlighted the need for pregnant women to be given advice about drinking, and support to stop drinking if necessary. ""There are no winners in a case like this,"" she added, saying she hoped it would be a ""wake-up call"" to make people think about the dangers of drinking when pregnant. The NHS recommends that pregnant women should not drink at all - adding that those who choose to have a drink should have no more than two units of alcohol once or twice a week."
education-30537561,Women take more places in rising university numbers,"The number of UK university entrants passed 500,000 for the first time in 2014, with women a third more likely to enter higher education than men, Ucas admissions service figures show.","By Sean CoughlanEducation correspondent Among 18-year-olds, 34% of women were allocated university places, compared with 26% of men, the widest ever gap. The gap is more than 50% in a quarter of parliamentary constituencies. The admissions figures also suggest more students with lower grades are getting places at top universities. About a third of applicants getting BBB grades got places in ""higher tariff"" universities, about twice as many as in 2011. There was also an increase in universities making unconditional offers to applicants they most want to recruit. Wide variations This year's university admissions figures show a rising tide of more applications, more offers and more accepted places. Some 512,400 people secured places in UK universities through Ucas applications in 2014, up nearly 17,000. The number of UK students rose 3% to 447,500, and there were increases in the number of students from outside the UK. But within the overall rising numbers there were big variations. The Ucas figures show women are much more likely to enter university than men. This applies to both rich and poor families and across almost all regions. According to Ucas, two decades ago there was no gender gap, but this has now become one of the most distinctive features of applications. While 26% of men go to university, in some constituencies the male entry rates are much lower - in Bristol South it is only 11% of 18-year-olds. In contrast there are constituencies where more than half of female school leavers go straight to university. Ucas says the gender gap in entry rates is the equivalent of 32,000 ""missing"" male students. Regional differences While the gap between male and female is at its widest ever, the gap between rich and poor is at its lowest. Record numbers of disadvantaged students are getting places in higher education, rising by 11% compared with last year. These students were particularly likely to enter with BTec qualifications, rather than A-levels. But the figures also suggest poorer pupils are still significantly less likely to attend the most selective universities than their wealthier peers, according to the charity Teach First. ""If we want to see the access gap become a thing of the past across higher education, it is vital that universities allocate more of their access budgets to outreach programmes with schools serving low-income communities, and that schools are provided with statutory guidance on how to provide specific advice for pupils thinking about applying to more selective and elite universities,"" said Teach First founder Brett Wigdortz. But regional differences remain across the UK. Young people in London and Northern Ireland are the most likely to enter university - those in Wales and the South West of England have the lowest entry rates. There are even lower figures for Scotland, but these are incomplete because Ucas does not cover admissions for all Scottish higher education. There are even wider local differences - with some places having average entry rates below 15% while others are above 50%. Buyers' market The admissions figures also show the growing competition between universities to attract students. Universities are making more offers than ever before, 1.8 million this year, with students with high predicted grades getting four or five offers. Students without A or A* grades at A-level were more likely this year to have got into a selective ""higher tariff"" university. For students with three B grades, 35% got places into a top-tier university, compared with 32% last year and 17% in 2011. Among students with BBC grades, 15% got places at higher tariff universities, compared with 6% in 2011. For applicants with DDE grades, 12% got into ""medium tariff"" universities and 58% found a place at a ""lower tariff"" university. Across all types of university, the Ucas figures show that 85% of 18-year-old applicants from England were accepted for a place somewhere. Mary Curnock Cook, Ucas chief executive, said the increase in university entrance by disadvantaged students was a ""stunning account of social change"". ""These trends are pushing the difference in entry rates between rich and poor to historic lows,"" she said. Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, said the rising number of applications represented the end of the volatility that followed the increase in tuition fees. ""It suggests a return to stability in university applications following the changes and dip in 2012,"" she said. Universities Minister Greg Clark said: ""For the first time ever over half a million students have entered higher education, with entry rates for students from disadvantaged backgrounds increasing by over 10% to its highest ever levels across the UK. ""Higher education is a transformational experience and that is why we are the first government to remove the limit on student numbers lifting the cap on aspiration."""

Olive ridley turtles, which lay their eggs on the beaches of a number of Mexican states between May and September, are considered to be facing a high risk of extinction in the wild. The cause of their death is still under investigation. It is not clear whether they got caught in the nets while still alive or were already dead when they became entangled. Experts say they could have been killed by harmful algae, fish hooks or could have suffocated while trapped in the nets. Mexico banned the capture of sea turtles in 1990 and there are stiff penalties for anyone killing them. A specialised federal attorney is investigating the case."

He was last seen going to bed in Ferry Gait Crescent at about 21:00 on Wednesday, but when his family woke he was not in the house. Supt Liz McAinsh said there have been no sightings of Mikaeel since then. The Child Rescue Alert system means calls to its 0300 200 0200 number will be answered by dedicated members of staff. Police said they are seeking information from anyone who has seen Mikaeel or anyone matching his description in the past 24 hours. They said there was no evidence to suggest criminality at the moment, but officers were ""keeping an open mind."" Mikaeel is 3ft tall and was possibly wearing a beige hooded jacket with grey fur-lined hood. He may also have had on black gloves with multi-coloured fingers, dark navy blue jogging bottoms, a grey pyjama top featuring an embroidered turquoise dinosaur on the chest and brown Clark shoes with two Velcro straps. He has a faded scar on the bridge of his nose and a sore on the left side of his mouth. Police sources have indicated that an operation in Waterfront Gait, a mile from Mikaeel's home, was not connected with the investigation into the boy's disappearance. There, officers detained a man as a witness in connection with an ""unconnected"" inquiry. Supt McAinsh said the focus of the police operation remained in the local area, and officers were working to narrow down the timescale in which Mikaeel went missing. She confirmed there had been no sightings of the missing boy, and no signs of a door being left open in the property. She was not aware of anyone else having access to the flat, she said. A number of people were helping officers with their inquiries, the officer said, but there were no suspects, and had been no arrests or formal detentions. She added: ""I would stress at the moment we have no indication at all of any criminality. It remains a missing person inquiry. ""Our concern is obviously - with the passage of time - he was last seen at 9 o'clock last night and it's a cold day that we had. ""I would ask people in the locality please continue searching in your own personal property. ""If your neighbours are away, then think about searching their gardens, their sheds, common stairs, wheely bins."" Mikaeel, who is British with Asian parents, was at home with his mother and four siblings, including his twin sister, on Wednesday night. Officers are speaking to ""all family members"" about the disappearance. Coastguard teams and lifeboats have been searching the shoreline in the Cramond and Drylaw area. Efforts were made to speak to Mikaeel's father, who is understood to be of Pakistani origin. Supt Liz Ainsh said: ""We've spoken to all key members of the family. We've been in contact with them and they are assisting us with our inquiries. ""We have no suspects because we have no evidence of any criminality. ""We haven't had any sightings of Mikaeel and that obviously causes us concern."" Supt McAinsh was asked by reporters if it would have been possible for a three-year-old boy to have got out of his home on his own. ""I have been assured that it is possible,"" she said. ""I would suggest also that anything's possible. ""Three-year-old children are quite resilient and they have quite a great deal of strength and ability to open doors and I'm assured that Mikaeel is capable of doing that."" Temperatures overnight in Edinburgh dropped to 2.3C (36F) by 04:00, according to the Met Office. The Police Scotland helicopter has been involved in the search operation. Supt McAinsh said: ""He would normally share a bedroom with his twin sister but my understanding is that he was sleeping in the bedroom alone last night."""
uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-18056773,Wenlok Jug stolen from Stockwood Discovery Centre,"A ""nationally significant"" bronze medieval jug has been stolen from a Bedfordshire museum.","The Wenlok Jug was taken from the Stockwood Discovery Centre in Luton at about 23:00 BST on Saturday. In 2005 it was nearly sold abroad, but a temporary export ban provided the opportunity for Luton Museum to raise the £750,000 needed to buy it. Director of Museums, Karen Perkins, called the theft ""extremely serious and upsetting"". She said: ""We are extremely proud that the Wenlok Jug is part of the collections at Stockwood Discovery Centre and are working extremely closely with police and investigators to do all we can to recover it. ""The Wenlok Jug is a nationally significant medieval object."" The jug is a very rare example of metalwork that can be associated with royalty from the 1400s. It is decorated with coats of arms and badges and is inscribed with the words ""My Lord Wenlok"". In May 2005 it went up for sale at Sotheby's and was nearly sold to New York's Metropolitan Museum. However its export was stopped in October of that year by culture minister David Lammy after experts ruled it was of ""outstanding significance"" for the study of bronze-working in medieval England. It is thought the jug was made for either William Wenlock, who died in 1391 and was canon of St Paul's Cathedral, or his great-nephew John, the first Lord Wenlock, who was a major figure in the 15th century."

He said he spotted them in a field he owns and at first thought they had been manmade but there were no footprints. It is thought the bales are formed when wind conditions are ideal to blow chunks of snow along, picking up more snow along the way. Forestry worker Mr Bayliss, 51, said he had ""never seen anything like it before"" and when he got closer he ""could see the sun through the middle, and they just made no sense"". He captured the images shortly after sunrise on Saturday. BBC weatherman Ian Fergusson said it was ""very rare"" that conditions were so perfect that snow rollers could be formed. You may also like: ""These are truly beautiful photos of a very rare meteorological phenomenon - called snow rollers or snow bales. Brian was very lucky to see these,"" Mr Fergusson said. ""Conditions have to be just right for snow rollers to occur: a smooth, un-vegetated hillside, such as in this case near Marlborough, enhances the chance of them being formed. ""A layer of thin snow, settled atop existing ice and not sticking to it, combined with specific temperature, moisture level and wind speed, are fundamental to the creation of these natural oddities."" If the wind is too strong, or too weak, or the snow is too tightly packed, snow rollers will not form. The resulting snowballs look like a hay bale, a doughnut or a Swiss roll, and can be hollow inside. ."

uk-england-manchester-44129386,Manchester Arena attack: Bomb 'injured more than 800',"More than 800 people are now known to have suffered physical and psychological injuries after the Manchester bombing, police have said.","Police previously reported 500 people were hurt in the Manchester Arena attack on 22 May 2017 in addition to the 22 killed. Salman Abedi detonated a home-made device at an Ariana Grande concert. Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson said the night's events would be ""forever"" etched in the city's history. ""We knew quickly 22 people had been murdered and we now know that there are over 800 people with physical and deep psychological injuries from the attack. ""Their lives have been altered forever,"" he said. ACC Jackson said the investigation team had worked hard to support those affected and had been ""consistently moved by the grace and dignity they show in trying to repair their lives"". ""Of course for many, the loss is too great for them to ever make a full recovery from this terrible event."" 'Flashbacks' One young girl has been left traumatised after seeing the bodies of those injured or killed as she left the concert. Erin said she has had flashbacks and struggled to sleep after the attack. She has since had help and said: ""I feel much better having the support... it shows such a difference it makes talking to someone about it."" Her mother Annette McNeil said the family had a ""really tough"" few months. ""For seven or eight months [she] just refused to talk about what she saw,"" she said. ""I knew she was sad but didn't know she was struggling so much as she hid it amazingly."" Meanwhile, Erin's older sister Caitlin said she has had a ""very different"" reaction to the disaster. She said it has made her want to do more things. ""I know life is shorter now and can be taken at any time."" The NHS set up the Manchester Resilience Hub (MRH) to help people across the UK affected by the attack, including concert goers, children, families and emergency workers. It provides a central point for mental health advice and support to help people receive appropriate care from services close to where they live. MRH said it contacted more than 6,000 people who bought tickets for the concert offering them a wellbeing screening programme which allows them to determine how they are feeling and if they need further help. It said more than 3,000 people completed the screening and/or received further help. ACC Jackson gave an insight into the size and scale of the investigation almost a year on from the suicide bombing. A team of about 100 investigators are still working full-time on the murder investigation ""preparing for a trial"". ACC Jackson said it was ""really difficult"" to give an update on the progress of the extradition of Abedi's brother Hashem Abedi who is currently in custody in Libya. A warrant for Hashem's arrest over allegations of murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to cause an explosion was also issued before the extradition bid on 1 November 2017. So far during the investigation, 2,000 witness statements have been taken, thousands of hours of CCTV examined, and officers have completed a fruitless search through 11,000 tonnes of rubbish at a landfill site in Bury for a blue suitcase used by Abedi."
